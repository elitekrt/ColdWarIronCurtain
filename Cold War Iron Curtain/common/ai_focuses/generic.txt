######NOTES######
#1. The AI in CWIC is set to NEVER research 2 things in the same category at once. The 4 categories are (air, navy, army, rocketry/WMD.)
#2. The AI in CWIC will try to maintain a minimum balance of civilian technologies researching at all times with a MINIMUM 1 industry or electronics, more active military research means the AI will research more industry/electronics
#3. "hardware_tech" is required for a vast majority of weapons
#4. Massively increasing the portion of military to civilian tech priorities will make the AI prioritize more slots to researching military BUT WILL ALWAYS SEEK TO USE AT LEAST 1 SLOT IN INDUSTRY/ELECTRONICS
#5. The AI in CWIC will research only things it can afford to produce in fairly large numbers. So no researching medium tanks with less than 30 military factories etc.
#6. The AI is told to NEVER Research ahead of time, but it still decides to sometimes anyway (vanilla bug)
