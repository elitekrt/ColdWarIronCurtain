 USA_a_modern_airforce1_desc:0 "The U.S.A.F. is the finest air force in the world, and we must make sure that it remains that way. We will modernise and reform our air force to ensure that we keep this key edge over the Soviets."
 USA_enable_the_us_navy1:0 "Enable the US Navy"
 USA_enable_the_us_navy1_desc:0 "Our Navy is the most important part of our armed forces. Without naval power, America cannot project her military might far from her borders, and we would have very few ways to thwart the Russians in their worldwide quest for dominance. We must invest in and expand the Navy and our shipbuilding capability."
 USA_mothball_the_us_navy:0 "Mothball the US Navy"
 USA_mothball_the_us_navy_desc:0 "The Navy makes up a huge chunk of our massive military budget. It would make more sense to downsize our Navy and focus instead on more cost-efficient means of controlling the waves."
 USA_american_commandos1_desc:0 "The strength of America's army lies in its special forces. We will intensify the training requirements for our Paratroopers, Marines, and Mountaineer brigades to ensure that they remain a high-quality fighting force."
 USA_the_marshall_plan1_desc:0 "Experience shows that extremism takes root in times of political and economic chaos - such as the situation Europe currently finds itself in. We must provide a massive investment of money and materials to rebuild Europe, lest we find them looking to Stalin, or another Hitler, to save them. "
 USA_foriegn_affairs_desc:0 "As the new Leader of the Free World and primary guardian against world Communism, we have many areas that demand our attention. We must decide which areas to intervene in and to what extent. "
 USA_mccarthy_presidency_desc:0 "In a shocking swerve, Joseph McCarthy has won the U.S. Presidential Election, and stands poised to retaliate against Communists both real and imagined."
 USA_reaction_to_mccarthyism_desc:0 "Senator Joseph Mccarthy has made a shocking accusation - that he has a list of over 200 members of the State Department that are members of the Communist Party! This senator from Wisconsin is whipping up a storm of outrage and paranoia across the country. We must decide how we are going to deal with this storm."
 USA_aid_roc_desc:0 "The Republican government of Chiang Kai-Shek is our firm ally in the East, but they are exhausted by the Japanese invasion of a few years ago. If we do not help them, then they will almost certainly fall to Mao Zedong's Communist regime, and with them, the dominoes in east Asia will start to topple."
 USA_advisors_roc_desc:0 "Supplying the Kuomintang with guns and equipment is not sufficient if they do not know how best to use them. The Chinese will benefit from the sage advice of our greatest military minds, which will surely help turn the Red Tide aside."
 USA_declare_war_on_prc_desc:0 "While we have thus far avoided any direct action in China for fear of Soviet reprisal, we can no longer stand idly by and watch as Asia slips into the shadow of Stalin. The President has opted to declare war upon Mao and his terrible regime, for the purposes of stabilizing and reorganising Northern China until it can be handed over to a responsible, Democratic Chinese state."
 USA_cut_off_roc_desc:0 "The Kuomintang are a mess - corrupt, undemocratic, and engaged in a hopeless war with the Communists. It is neither moral nor prudent to continue propping up Kai-Shek's regime."
 USA_recognize_prc_desc:0 "Distasteful though it may be, we cannot deny that Mao Zedong has won the war for supremacy over China. We should move to recognize the PRC as the legitimate government of China, in the hope that we can contest Moscow's influence over them."
 USA_anti_soviet_alliance_desc:0 "While Mao is a Marxist, he is rather unorthodox, and there is much tension between Beijing and the Kremlin. If we approach the PRC with sufficient tact, we may be able to convince Mao to sign an alliance with us against Stalin, despite our ideological differences."
 USA_restart_marshall_mission_desc:0 "In 1945 we sent General George Marshall to negotiate peace between the Communist and Nationalist governments in China. The corruption and pigheadedness of both governments resulted in this mission failing, with Marshall withdrawing in 1947. We must redouble our efforts and send another mission, for the sake of peace, stability, and security against the Soviets."
 USA_press_for_peace_desc:0 "We were not insistent enough during the 1945-1947 Marshall mission. We must make a full commitment to diplomatically pressuring both sides into accepting a ceasefire."
 USA_push_for_yangtze_border_desc:0 "At last, our diplomats have made some headway and found a solution that may be acceptable to both sides. We will attempt to draw the dividing line between the two Chinas at the historic Yangtze River. Perhaps this will finally put an end to the bloodshed."
 USA_compromise_with_congress_desc:0 "While it would of course be preferable to pass every act unopposed, the President must realise that in a democracy, not every one of his proposals will go through. We should be more willing to compromise with Congress, even when it forces us to water down our proposals and prevents us from doing what we wish. After all, they represent the American people too."
 USA_the_bully_pulpit_desc:0 "Congress is a nuisance, constantly hampering the President's efforts to carry out his wise reforms and thwarting his will at every step. We should undermine their legitimacy by convincing the American people that Congress is unfairly hampering the President's efforts to help them."
 USA_korea_desc:0 "The Korean Peninsula is a a key strategic asset. Because of its proximity to both China and Japan, it will pose a vital staging ground and outpost for whomever controls it. We cannot allow it to fall into Communist hands, both for the sake of the Korean people and for the safety of our allies in East Asia."
 USA_fair_society_desc:0 "We must ensure a fair and equal society for all Americans."
 USA_truman_assasination_desc:0 "Truman must be gotten out of the way, by any means necessary."
 USA_expansion_of_social_security_desc:0 "We already spend millions of dollars yearly on costly and risky projects to contain the spread of world Communism, while every day, millions of Americans suffer from the loss of income caused by ill health, unemployment, and old age. This vast wealth be better spent improving the quality of life of our citizens."
 USA_crack_down_on_strikes_desc:0 "While the Trade Unions promised not to strike during the War so as to ensure the defeat of Nazism, this promise has now expired, and they are beginning to cause trouble again. We should take a harder line on disruptive strike action, to make it more difficult for the trade unions to disrupt American industry and to hamper the growth of Communist infiltration in our nation."
 USA_end_military_segregation_desc:0 "Currently, the U.S. armed forces only allows units to be of homogeneous racial origin. This is not only unjust, it also results in tension in the armed forces and results in difficulty in finding the right man to fill the right role. We should end this practice and integrate the army, for reasons both moral and practical."
 USA_continue_price_controls_desc:0 "During the War, we established strict controls on how much could be charged for certain goods and services, to enable us to get our economy in war-ready shape. Economists are pressuring for the lifting of these controls now that the War is over, arguing that they result in shortages, but we know better. We will continue government control over vital industries."
 USA_repeal_taft_hartley_desc:0 "The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act, places unfair restrictions on what union workers can legally do to protect their rights. We must repeal this unjust act to preserve the rights of our people."
 USA_brennan_plan_desc:0 "During the War, there was a great need for food in the Allies, and we paid farmers far above market rates to produce as much as they could. However, with the war over, thousands of farmers now find themselves with piles of food they cannot sell. We will sell off this surplus at market rates, then pay the farmers compensation for the fact that they can no longer sell at wartime rates."
 USA_housing_act_of_1949_desc:0 "The US faces a huge housing shortage, and many Americans are stewing in suburban slums. This cannot stand - we will introduce a massive program for the removal of slums, the building of affordable housing, and to provide mortgage insurance so that every American can have a good home."
 USA_increase_min_wage_desc:0 "It is the firm belief of this Administration that basic social justice requires the American worker an entitlement to a just and reasonable wage for his work. We will increase the minimum wage, so as to afford our workers at least a minimum level of economic sufficiency and security."
 USA_political_freedom_of_conscience_desc:0 "It is a fundamental right of every human being to be able not only to hold, but to publicly express his earnest and sincerely-held belief, without the fear of public reprisal. It is this great freedom that safeguards our Republic from falling into tyranny, and we must make sure to publicly enshrine this principle in our statements and efforts."
 USA_condemn_mccarthy_as_insane_desc:0 "Joseph McCarthy is a dangerous and volatile force, a loose cannon whose collateral damage cannot be predicted. We should publicly condemn him in an attempt to end his self-righteous and counter-productive crusade against members of our government."
 USA_discredit_eisenhower_desc:0 "Dwight. D. Eisenhower, though a respected war hero, is not amenable to our plans for the future. We ought to smear his name so as to remove him as a political threat."
 USA_preserve_colonial_empires_desc:0 "While we have always thought ourselves as anti-colonialists, we should avoid putting too much pressure on our colonialist allies. France and Britain are our vital allies in th struggle against the Soviets, and pushing them to abandon their colonial empires will only weaken and anger them, perhaps pushing them into Stalin's arms."
 USA_arm_imperialist_vietnam_desc:0 "Ho Chi Minh and his Communist revolutionaries are stirring up trouble in Vietnam. We ought to send weaponry and supplies to the Vietnamese government to help them stamp out the fires of revolution."
 USA_vietnam_advisors_desc:0 "The Vietnamese government suffers from a lack of experienced military advisors to train its army. We ought to send them advisors to train their officers and help them to preserve their own safety."
 USA_operation_vulture_desc:0 "The French garrison in Dien Bien Phu has been surrounded by Vietminh soldiers. They will surely be killed if nobody acts to save them. We will send support to them via waves of B-29 bombers. We are even thinking of sending nuclear bombs to the aid of the French..."
 USA_eisenhower_doctrine_desc:0 "The Middle East is a tempting target for world communism, being a region filled with discontent and flush with vital oil resources that both we and the Free World need. We should make it clear that any Middle Eastern country can appeal to us for aid against Communist aggression, for their sake and for ours."
 USA_new_look_policy_desc:0 "Our current military spending was based on the assumption that the Soviets would reach a maximum "cap" on their military capability compared to us sometime in the 1950s. It now seems unlikely that the Soviet military capability will level out as we expected, so we should switch to a long-haul strategy focussing on air defense and nuclear arms rather than standing armies and navies."
 USA_army_macarthur_hearings_desc:0 "McCarthy is having a very negative influence on our government and on public perception of the government. We have managed to find an accusation against him, of improperly pressuring army officials, and will have him engage in a live, televised hearing about them. Maybe when the American people see him in person, they will turn against him."
 USA_refugee_relief_act_desc:0 "There has recently been a surge of refugees from Southern Europe, including several Communist countries. Our current immigration provisions do not allow for them to enter the United States, but we should pass a new Act permitting the resettlement of these poor, displaced people (subject to certain checks and controls, of course)."
 USA_support_monarchism_iran_desc:0 "Stability in the Middle East is paramount, for the area is full of oil and Communist agitators. Popular discontent with Iran's ruling Pahlavi Dynasty has blossomed with Soviet support. We must help the Shah to shore up popular support and quell Red Dissent. If we do not, the whole Middle East may fall before long."
 USA_operation_ajax_desc:0 "The Iranian Shah has proven to be receptive to Western ideas, but his government is considerably less open-minded. Together with the British, we have approached a powerful Iranian military man and asked him to help us stabilize the Shah's grip over his unruly parliament."
 USA_arm_imperialist_persia_desc:0 "Now that we have helped the Shah to bolster his control of Iran, we should ensure that armed uprising is also prevented. We will send considerable quantities of weapons and ammunition to Persia, to reinforce our loyal ally."
 USA_malayam_emergency_aid_desc:0 "Malaya has been suffering from a Communist insurgency, a war complicated by the fact that the Communists are primarily fighting against colonial oppression. We should send aid to Malaya to help quell this emergency."
 USA_advisors_to_malaysia_desc:0 "Like many East Asian nations, Malaya suffers from a relative lack of experience in modern warfare. We should send military advisors to aid them in their struggle against the Communist insurgency."
 USA_intervene_in_malaysia_desc:0 "We have lost faith in the Malayan government's ability to handle the MLA revolutionaries on their own. We have decided to step in ourselves to contain the spread of world Communism."
 USA_science_funding_desc:0 "The future of America lies in the advancement of science and the education of our young people in the sciences. We should increase funding to these vital areas, lest we fall behind in the race with Russia."
 USA_support_african_colonialism_desc:0 "Our allies in Europe need the resources from their colonial markets in order to rebuild their economies and remain strong in the face of the Warsaw Pact's influence. To this end, we should support their efforts at maintaining peace and order in their colonies."
 USA_advisors_french_algeria_desc:0 "French Algeria is an area suffering from particularly fierce nationalistic sentiment. The French will need the help of our military advisors if they are to maintain stability in the region."
 USA_intervene_in_algeria_desc:0 "The Algerian nationalist rebels have proven surprisingly skilled and determined. The French can no longer be relied upon to keep their North African colonies safe - we must intervene to ensure peace."
 USA_crack_down_on_organized_crime_desc:0 "The Mafia and other forms of organised crime are an epidemic upon our society. Blackmail, extortion, murder, robbery, and all manner of vices are inflicted upon our society by these criminals. They can no longer be ignored, and must be suppressed by any means at our disposal."
 USA_expand_missle_research_desc:0 "During the invasion of Nazi Germany, we rescued and gave amnesty to many German rocket scientists. Their expertise will greatly accelerate our rocketry program - after all, the military potential of this field cannot be overestimated."
 USA_the_interstate_highway_system_desc:0 "Travel and trade across America is hindered by unsafe roads and inefficient route planning. We will engage in a road-building project of unprecedented scale, to provide a far superior system of roads that will streamline American life."
 USA_statehood_for_alaska_and_hawaii_desc:0 "Currently, Alaska and Hawaii are Organized Incorporated Territories, and not full States. We should move to extend full statehood, but Congress is not willing to approve either state seperately, since Alaska is majority Republican and Hawaii is majority Democrat. Therefore, they must both become States in quick succession."
 USA_nasa_desc:0 "New technologies have opened the startling possibility of leaving this planet on which we have dwelled for the entirety of our history. Furthermore, the Soviets have also shown interest in this venture, and so far they have the lead in the "space race". We will establish the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to advance American exploration of outer space."
 USA_latam_operations_desc:0 "Latin America is our back yard, and we will not tolerate any socialist subversion so close to our borders. The fall of any American country to a Communist regime could potentially give the Soviets a foothold within a few scant hundred miles of our borders, and that will not be tolerated."
 USA_PBSUCCESS_desc:0 "Guatemala is controlled by a liberalising government that has altogether too many ties to Communism for our comfort. We have drawn up a plan that will replace Guatemala's current administration with one that is more amenable to our objectives."
 USA_democratic_regime_gua_desc:0 "The establishment of an autocratic government in Guatemala was an error on our part, a great injustice against the people of Guatemala. We ought to allow a democratically-elected government to take power."
 USA_gua_military_junta_desc:0 "The dictatorship we have established in Guatemala is not stable enough to reliably oppose Communist infiltration. We should arrange for a firmer, stronger government to take power."
 USA_support_arab_cause_desc:0 "The Arabs and the Israelis have tense and uneasy relationship with each other, but there are a good deal more Arabs than Israelis. In the interests of regional stability in the Middle East, we should support the Arab cause."
 USA_arm_arab_states_desc:0 "The Arab nations are being targeted by the Russians, who are attempting to fund Communist rebels within their countries. We should provide weapons and ammunition to them, to help them resist Socialist insurgency."
 USA_arab_advisors_desc:0 "Our Arab allies will benefit from the advice of our skilled military officers."
 USA_economic_and_oil_development_Desc:0 "The Middle East is awash with oil, but the Arab countries lack the ability to effectively access most of it. We will invest significant capital in our Arabian allies, to enable them to tap into their vast natural resources."
 USA_gua_corporate_puppet_desc:0 "The United Fruit Company is an American corporation that had significant interests in Guatemala before the recent instability. They have petitioned us to allow them to expand their influence in the country, to enable America to more effectively protect her allies and preventing the spread of socialism."
 USA_support_israel_desc:0 "The Jewish people are part of our shared Judeo-Christian heritage. We must support the Israelis in their noble attempt to defend their nation from foreign aggression."
 USA_arm_israel_desc:0 "The Jewish people suffered terribly during the Second World War, and now they have moved to reclaim a part of their ancestral homeland in Israel. However, they are surrounded by large populations of hostile Arabs, who are not yet ready to co-exist with them. We must supply Israel with the arms that it needs to defend itself."
 USA_israeli_advisors_desc:0 "Israel requires the assistance of our military advisors to ensure the security of their borders."
 USA_support_israeli_economically_desc:0 "It will not be enough to give guns to Israel - we must ensure that they have economic prosperity such that they do not want for anything. We will invest massive amounts of capital and industry in Israel publicly, and will also encourage private investment in Israel's economy."
 USA_support_honduras_coup_desc:0 "Honduras's government has been suspicious as of late. There are rumours that their labor laws are becoming more liberalised, and allegations that Communist sympathisers are infiltrating the government. There are conservative elements within Honduras that wish to get rid of this crypto-Communist cabinet. Perhaps we should support this initiative?"
 USA_arm_militarist_honduras_desc:0 "We should provide weapons and ammunition to the government of Honduras, in order to better ensure their ability to defend themselves against Communist insurgency."
 USA_arm_korea_desc:0 "South Korea is in a highly vulnerable position in East Asia. We ought to send large amounts of materiel support, to ensure that they can defend themselves against threats both internal and external."
 USA_south_korean_economy_desc:0 "Korea is underdeveloped at the moment, but that is largely because of their long oppression under the Japanese. We, however, see great potential in the economy of Korea, and will invest heavily in developing our ally."
 USA_defend_the_border_desc:0 "We cannot afford to launch an offensive against North Korea, but the Kim regime is too dangerous to simply be ignored. We will built a system of fortifications and landmines that should slow down or even stop a North Korean offensive in the case of a war within the peninsula."
 USA_pre_emptive_strike_desc:0 "Allowing the Kim regime to fester will only make the problem worse. We will end the threat of Communism in Korea now, before they have a chance to spread their poison any further."
 USA_operation_blue_bat_desc:0 "Lebanon is a country split between Muslims and Maronite Christians. The recent Lebanese President has been drawing close to the West, angering some of the Islamic population and causing domestic unrest. We should commence an operation to bolster the government of Lebanon, in order to keep them from drawing away from the West."
 USA_arm_lebanon_desc:0 "To further reinforce the Lebanese government, we should send them American-made arms and armor to ensure the government's ability to resist against threats both foreign and domestic."
 USA_pull_out_of_korea_desc:0 "Korea is not an area of our concern. The peninsula is divided in a highly unnatural and difficult-to-defend manner, and it would be a waste of enormous amounts of resources to keep our combat troops stationed in the South any longer."
 USA_arm_tibetan_uprising_desc:0 "The Tibetan people have risen up against occupation by China. We see no reason why the Tibetan people should not have the right of self-determination, so we will send arms to the rebels in order to aid the cause of Tibetan independence."
 USA_return_our_boys_home1_desc:0 "The War is finally over, but there are still hundreds of thousands of American soldiers deployed on garrison duty in Europe. While the threat of the Soviets is a real one, that does not mean that US troops need constantly occupy Germany and France. We will hand these duties over to our allies and begin letting our boys return to their families."
 USA_consolidate_the_army1_desc:0 "Without the threat of Nazi Germany, there is no longer a justification for keeping millions of soldiers mobilized continuously. Our defense against the Soviets will be much better served by a consolidated army consisting of trained professionals, rather than by conscripted soldiers."
 USA_return_to_domestic_defense_policy1_desc:0 "Why should American taxpayers have to foot the bill to keep Europe, Africa, and Asia protected? We should return to a policy of Domestic Defense only, where our Army defends the American mainland, rather than having to defend every country in the Western Hemisphere at once."
 USA_end_of_colonization_desc:0 "The colonial era has come to an end, and the oppression of non-Europeans by Europeans is an anachronistic injustice. We should publicly move to support the independence movements of the world's colonies. After all, if we do not free them ourselves, they may look to Russia for their salvation..."
 USA_call_for_de_colonization_desc:0 "So far we have treated Britain and France with kid gloves, never seriously pressuring them to grant independence to their colonies. That time is over - it is about time we made it very clear that we will not tolerate the continued and indefinite existence of colonial powers within the Free World."
 USA_the_treaty_ports_desc:0 "In the nineteenth century the then-dominant European powers forced the transfer of several Chinese ports to their direct rule, to facilitate trade. The Chinese have been rightfully bitter about this arrangement ever since, and now that the Kuomintang are our allies, we should pressure Britain and Portugal to return the Treaty Ports to Chinese control."
 USA_fund_shia_radicals_desc:0 "The Pahlavi monarchy in Iran is hopelessly corrupt and weak. They are living proof of the follies of autocratic rule. We have caught wind of a populist uprising against the monarchy, and in the name of liberty, we must support those who wish to free themselves from the tyranny of absolutism."
 USA_recognize_iranian_government_desc:0 "Stable government in the Middle East is of paramount importance. We cannot afford to have a violent rebellion overturning the political order in the Middle East at such a critical time. We must officially support Iran's Pahlavi monarchy against th insurgency aimed at toppling them."
 USA_iranian_industrial_development_desc:0 "If we want the Middle East to be stable, we must have a stable and friendly Iran. If we want a stable and friendly Iran, then Iran must be wealthy and content. It only makes sense for us to invest in Iran, to improve their economy."
 USA_further_deployment_to_europe1_desc:0 "Some members of the armed forces are calling for our troops to be demobilised from Europe, but we know better. The War with the Nazis may be over, but the need for men to fight for freedom is not. A foul spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of Communism. We must not only refuse demobilisation, we must send even more troops to defend Europe!"
 USA_establish_us_european_command1_desc:0 "If we are to conduct operations in Europe to contain Soviet Influence, then it will not be enough merely to have troops. Four million soldiers cannot properly be managed from across the ocean. We must establish an explicit military command structure headquartered in Europe, to handle the organisation of our European operations."
 USA_mobilize_against_the_ussr1_desc:0 "If we are to go to total war with the Soviets, it will be one of the greatest undertakings that the American people have ever shouldered. Nobody has successfully invaded Russia since the time of the Mongols, and if we are going to succeed, we will need every able-bodied man to be willing to give his life for the cause."
 USA_the_korean_war_draft_desc:0 "The Korean War could easily become a protracted affair against an entrenched enemy, a stagnant war. We will lower the minimum age for someone to be drafted into the army to 18 and a half years, to make more manpower available for th war effort."
 USA_mountain_assualt1_desc:0 "America's finest troops are our special forces. We should expand mountain ops training to as many soldiers as possible, to maximise our ability to fight in mountainous regions the world over."
 USA_condemn_african_colonialism_desc:0 "The peoples of Africa have suffered immensely under the burden of colonialism. It is a matter of the utmost moral importance to denounce this evil, and put pressure on Britain, France, and Portugal to grant their African colonies independence."
 USA_algerian_democratic_front_desc:0 "Algeria is a hotbed of nationalism, as the Berber people strive to achieve independence from France. We should support them, to assure that when they do gain their independence, they are friendly and open to an alliance with us."
 USA_start_uprising_algeria_desc:0 "The time has finally come. Our Algierian nationalist allies have been appealing to us for months now to begin a decisive military campaign against the French, and at last everything is in place. The uprising will begin."
 USA_reform_our_doctrine1_desc:0 "We have come out of the Second World War one of the world's dominant powers, but our land army is inferior to the Soviet Red Army. If we are to have any chance of holding back Soviet invasion in Europe, then we must modernise our ways of thinking about war."
 USA_grow_our_talons1_desc:0 "Our greatest strength is our air force. The U.S.A.F is renowned throughout the world for excellence of service. We must focus heavily on this field, because we cannot afford to lose our trump card against the Soviets."
 USA_amphious_warfare1_desc:0 "The U.S. Marine Corps is perhaps the most famous military unit in the entire world. We must make sure to maintain this, and invest in Amphibious Warfare technology - unlike the Soviets, we are likely to have to operate in parts of the world where we have no land border, and the Marines will be essential to these wars."
 USA_american_airborne_forces1_desc:0 "Paratroopers are a vital part of the future of warfare. By expanding the Paratrooper Corps, we can ensure that we are able to field a large contingent of airborne infantry."
 USA_special_forces1_desc:0 "We will never have the population necessary to match the Soviets in raw manpower, so we must ensure that we use our soldiers smarter and more efficiently. To that end, we should focus our efforts on our Special Forces divisions, which will give us the edge in tactical flexibility over the Russian juggernaut."
 USA_expand_our_numbers1_desc:0 "Uncle Sam needs you! We must ensure that all young Americans are instilled with the virtue of patriotism, and that each man will see the army as a glorious undertaking in the worldwide defense of freedom!"
 USA_collabrative_efforts_desc:0 "We must keep our technological edge over the Soviets if we are to triumph over world Communism. We should collaborate more closely with our allies in Europe to ensure that we remain at the bleeding edge of scientific research."
 USA_eagles_talons1_desc:0 "While our fighter aircraft are top of the line, it is bombers that allow us to turn air superiority into victories in war. We will expand our bomber research, to make sure we can project air power anywhere around the globe."
 USA_begin_a_european_recovery1_desc:0 "The devastation wreaked upon the countries of Europe by the First World War played a huge part in the rise of both Communism and Fascism. The lesson is clear - extremist ideologies gain power from political instability, and political instability comes from economic chaos and poverty. Therefore, if we want to fortify Europe against Communism, we must rebuild it and make it rich."
 USA_nets_for_flemmish_fishermen1_desc:0 "The Flemish fishing industry was hit heavily by the War. Sending them modern, up-to-date fishing equipment would significantly bolster the Belgian economy."
 USA_construction_equipment_and_engineers_to_france1_desc:0 "France was utterly devastated by Nazi invasion and occupation, and is dealing with unrest in its crumbling colonial empire. We must send masses of construction materials and engineers to France to rebuild their infrastructure and economy."
 USA_rebuild_italys_auto_indsutry1_desc:0 "While Italy was an Axis Power in the War, we must help them also, for they are closer than most of Western Europe to the threat of Communism. Italy's motor industry lies in ruins after the War, and we must invest in Italian companies to revive it."
 USA_coal_exports_to_denmark1_desc:0 "We will expand Denmark's industry by providing them with cheap coal to fuel their factories."
 USA_food_distribution_to_europe1_desc:0 "The United States was blessed with wide oceans on two sides, preventing any enemy power from invading its mainland. Thus, our agriculture was not interrupted by bombing or seized by invaders. Europe was not so lucky, and starvation is a real danger in many parts of France and especially Germany. We will export massive amount of food to help the suffering people of Europe."
 USA_consolidate_our_positions1_desc:0 "The U.S. Navy is the most powerful navy in the world, but we must not be complacent in our superiority. The Soviets are aware of this and are likely to invest heavily in their fleet. We must ensure that we keep pace with them."
 USA_rebuild_and_modernize_our_navy1_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers are the future of naval warfare, able to project air power thousands of miles beyond any naval base. We must rebuild our navy around this reality."
 USA_a_truly_american_navy1_desc:0 "At last, our Navy is beginning to take the shape we had envisaged for it. We will continue our Carrier expansion program, so that our Fleet's might will be spoken of for generations, much like the British Navy of days past."
 USA_the_macarthur_question1_desc:0 "General MacArthur has allowed his fame to get to his head. He has opposed our policy on the war in Korea, but recently he has made his criticisms public and pursued a dangerously aggressive policy towards China. Many worry that his control over the occupation of Japan have made him into something of a dictator. He must be reminded that he reports to the President."
 USA_a_rebuilt_europe1_desc:0 "Europe has risen from the ashes of war, with the aid of American investment. The nations of Western Europe are beginning to recover, and their economies are showing signs of growth unheard of in years. The next logical step is the investment in European roads and railways, so that this newfound wealth can flow more freely."
 USA_a_new_threat1_desc:0 "The Soviet Menace is the greatest threat to liberty that the Free World has faced since the fall of Nazism. Western Europe is a vital bulwark against the spread of Communism. We have strengthened Europe such that economic turmoil will probably not drive them into Moscow's arms, but we must arm them too, so that they can defend themselves from more direct aggression."
 USA_call_for_nato_members_to_return_treaty_ports_roc_desc:0 "Now that the Republic of China is our ally, it is really inexcusable that members of NATO should unjustly hold Chinese land. We will petition the Europeans to return the Treaty Ports to China."
 USA_iranian_civil_war_desc:0 "Support for the anti-Pahlavi rebels has grown enormously within Iran. The time is now ripe for a revolution to overthrow the monarchy."
 USA_arm_greek_government_desc:0 "The Greeks have already suffered from Communist insurgents. We must send arms and supplies to them to ensure that the Kremlin cannot get their toe into the Mediterranean."
 USA_economic_aid_to_greece_desc:0 "The Greek economy is in something of a shambles following World War 2 and th subsequent Communist civil war. We must provide them economic aid to ensure that the Greek people will not need to look to Communism for its salvation."
 USA_invite_greece_nato_desc:0 "Greece is vulnerable, being close to Russia and the other Warsaw Pact nations. We must spend considerable political and diplomatic effort to ensure their protection."
 USA_McCarran_internal_security_act_desc:0 "We must always be wary of the influence of Communist organisations on our great country. We will pass an Act requiring all Communist organisations to register with the Government, as well as make it easier to find and prosecute those suspected of subversion or espionage against our democratic freedoms."
 USA_join_anti_communist_movement_desc:0 "We have been altogether too soft towards the Reds so far. Boycotts? Containment? Half-measures at best! We must devote our nation whole-heatedly to the explicit destruction of world Communism."
 USA_purge_state_department_desc:0 "The State Department is filled with Communist spies and interwoven with the webs of espionage. We must purge from our government all of those who would seek to sell the nation to the Soviets."
 USA_civil_rights_act_of_1959_desc:0 "The racial inequalities in American society are a tragedy and injustice(not to mention the fact that the Communists frequently use it as a rhetorical club to beat us with). We must seek to eliminate the technically-legal but obviously discriminatory voting laws in the South which all but disenfranchise non-whites."
 USA_subvert_democratic_system_desc:0 "The balance of powers within the American government is a threat to world stability. How can America hope to defend the world from Communism if we deliberately hamstring our own government? We must remove any obstacles to the power of the Presidency."
 USA_military_junta_desc:0 "While democracy is a time-honored American tradition, we need stability now more than ever. As Abraham Lincoln once said, you don't change horses mid-stream, and you don't change leaders during a war. We are at war with Communism, and will be at war for the foreseeable future. We must ensure the stability needed to win this war."
 USA_spread_fascism_desc:0 "Our allies are not sufficiently motivated in the struggle against the Reds, and many of them would prefer policies of appeasement to dealing with the problem. Fools! Do they not remember what happened the last time they tried to appease a dictator? We must make sure that the Free World is led by stronger, more dynamic men."
 USA_crusade_agaisnt_communism_desc:0 "The time has finally come. We are prepared, our armies are ready, and our allies have braced themselves. Today we embark on the greatest war that has ever been fought in human history. Today, we embark on a great Crusade against evil and tyranny the likes of which has never, and may never be equalled. Glory, Glory Hallelujah! Victory to the United States!"
 USA_show_trials_on_opposition_figures_desc:0 "Mccarthy has constantly been opposed by Communist traitors in his noble quest to protect America from subversion. Now that he is President, he finally has the power to get rid of all of the traitors who wanted to destroy America."
 USA_embrace_nationalism_desc:0 "For too long, the American people have been ashamed to be called Nationalists. They associate the term with racism, blood-and-soil rhetoric, and pointless wars. This is altogether mistaken! Nationalism merely means a love of your country! We must oppose the whimpering Internationalism of the Communists with a red-blooded nationalist spirit."
 USA_paramilitary_american_legion_desc:0 "The American Legion is an honorable society for our military veterans, but we see no reason why their skills should go to waste. We will turn the American Legion into a unified, patriotic force of skilled warriors, under McCarthy's personal supervision."
 USA_outlaw_leftist_opposition_desc:0 "The second-worst enemy of America is Liberalism, for Liberalism inevitably leads to Communism. Was it not the Liberals who obstructed McCarthy's attempts to purge America of Communists, under their whining about slippery slopes and rights of conscience? To safeguard the security of America, all Leftist organisations must be banned."
 USA_isolationism_desc:0 "America's intervention in the Second World War was a necessary evil for the destruction of Nazism. We promised no more and we will give no more. President Taft is determined to withdraw America from her entanglements in Europe. After all, we must serve and protect America first."
 USA_asian_pivot_desc:0 "President Taft has decided that it would be far more to America's benefit to focus on co-operation with her allies on the Pacific Coast, rather than engage in a doomed land war with the Russians in Europe."
 USA_pacifica_desc:0 "We must formalise our relations with our Pacific allies into a true alliance - the Pacific Treaty Organisation."
 USA_stevenson_presidency_desc:0 "Adlai Stevenson has won the Presidency, and plans to implement extensive economic and social reforms."
 USA_kefauver_presidency_desc:0 "Estes Kefauver has won the Presidency, and will crack down on big business trusts and organised crime."
 USA_macarthur_presidency_desc:0 "Douglas MacArthur has won the Presidency, riding on his reputation as a war hero. He plans to devote the entire American Nation to the destruction of Communism."
 USA_eisenhower_presidency_desc:0 "Dwight Eisenhower has won the Presidency, and intends to sternly oppose world Communism through international cooperation and massive retaliation nuclear warfare policies."
 USA_taft_presidency_desc:0 "Robert Taft Jr. has won the Presidency, and plans to withdraw America from the tangle of European politics."
 USA_the_deutsche_mark1_desc:0 "The German currency was, unsurprisingly, utterly ruined by defeat in the War. Since then, Germans have resorted to using American cigarettes as a form of currency, and the black market is thriving. Germany will never be rebuilt if it goes on like this. As part of the Marshall Plan, we must re-introduce a proper, American-backed currency in Germany."
 USA_final_year_of_eisenhowers_presidency_desc:0 "Over his many years in the Oval Office, Dwight D. Eisenhower has seen many crises and troubles - uprisings, revolutions, the establishment of NASA, and the construction of the massive Interstate highway. Now, as the last year of his Presidency draws near, he prepares for one last voyage at the helm of the ship of state."
 USA_the_space_race_desc:0 "In 1957 the USSR launched Sputnik, the first ever man-made satellite. This terrified our people - our safety depends on technological superiority over the Soviets, and this launch raised doubts over that superiority. In response, we established NASA and are developing our own space program. We must win this race to the stars, to soothe the minds of our people."
 USA_nuclear_program_desc:0 "The Cold War will be won by he who has the most nuclear missiles. We must ensure that our nuclear arsenal remains the finest in the world, so that the Soviets will always have reason to fear our wrath."
 USA_elections_of_1964_desc:0 "The President's term has finally run out, and a new election must be held. This election is expected to be contested in equal measure between social issues and foreign policy, with the two most promising candidates being the Democrat Lyndon Johnson and the Republican Barry Goldwater. However, you can never know whether a surprise candidate will appear..."
 USA_The_Election_of_1968_desc:0 "It is time once again to go to the polls to decide who will lead our great nation. The most promising candidates are Democratic Hubery Humphrey and Republican Richard Nixon, though George Wallace, an independent from Alabama, has also announced his intention to run."
 USA_The_Election_of_1972_desc:0 "It is time once again to go to the polls to decide who will lead our great nation."
 USA_the_CIA_desc:0 "We will never win the Cold War without a strong intelligence service. Espionage has enormous importance, both for stealing the secrets of our enemies and for preventing Russian spies from stealing our secrets. We must expand the functions of the CIA massively in order to ensure our security."
 USA_The_Civil_Rights_Movement_desc:0 "Despite efforts towards the end of the previous decade, black and other minority groups still suffer enormously from discrimination in our country. The popular discontent has grown louder in recent years, blossoming into a full-blown social movement. Whether this movement will follow the path of peaceful or violent resistance is one that remains to be seen."
