 Suez_Crisis_Gulf.51.d:0 "The recent Suez Crisis has enflamed Arab passions in Bahrain as thousands are said to be rioting against the British aggression towards Egypt. British buildings and vehicles are being targeted as the rioters demand an end of British influence on Bahrain. The ruling monarchy appears incapable of using its own forces to quell the riots, with some fearing soldiers may join the rioters. Instead the King has asked the British to deploy its own forces and end the violence. The British have agreed, and British troops quickly deployed to end the rioting and restore peace. The rioters have reacted mostly by pelting British forces with rocks and burning vehicles. However, the British are confident order will be restored soon."
 NUC.5.d:0 "In response to the recent expansion of the oil industry, sectarian unrest, and animosity towards British influence, a new party has emerged in Bahrain. Called the National Unity Committee, the party is led by a committee of four Sunnis and four Shias to pressure the government to allow trade unions, end British influence, and combat sectarianism in the country. Despite the party platform appearing at odds with the monarchy, the government of Bahrain has decided to legalize the party and accept it as a legitimate political force in the country. The move is being welcomed locally as a sign of a mature monarchy. However, pro-British elements and traditionalists fear legalizing the part risks legalizing more radical political thoughts than the country can handle."
 BAH_FEDERATION.1.d:0 "The government of Bahrain, with input from its British advisors have requested support for the formation of a Arab Gulf Federation to include Bahrain, Muscat, and the Trucial States. The government notes these states possess a shared historical legacy of connections through trade and identity. More importantly, these areas possess valuable natural resources and a strong Arab Gulf Federation is the only way to ensure an outside power does not take them over and exploit these resources. They also note this proposed nation would take the burden of defense and lift the burden from the British military. London is said to be considering the request closely. The larger regional powers in the region are said to be following the situation with slight concern as such a federation would change the dynamics in the region."
 BAH_FEDERATION.2.d:0 "The British government, after intense meetings has decided to accept the proposal from the government of Bahrain to form a new nation called the Arab Gulf Federation. This new state will unite Bahrain, Muscat, and the Trucial States. The British were apparently convinced by the proposal and see an advantage to having the natural resources of these states under a unified authority. Members of the British military were noted as saying this would ensure the protection of these resources from neighboring states and will reduce the pressure on Britain to defend these lands. Although the British government appears quite satisfied, some observers note the Arab Gulf Federation will have to manage the egos of several absolute rulers and note such a state may end up destabilizing the region overtime."
 BAH_FEDERATION.3.d:0 "The British government, after intense meetings has decided to reject the proposal from the government of Bahrain to form a new nation called the Arab Gulf Federation. This new state would have united Bahrain, Muscat, and the Trucial States. The British government noted it respected the proposal from its close ally in Bahrain but concluded such a state was not feasible or in the interests of the people in the region. The Bahrain government will likely be upset by this development and already rumors are spreading the British decision was a conspiracy to ensure these Arab states remained weak and divided. However, the news is being welcomed by the regional powers who had feared such a state could threaten the balance of power in the region."
 BAH_FEDERATION.4.d:0 "Following the approval of the British government, the leaders of Bahrain, Muscat, and the Trucial States immediately began implementing plans for the formation of the Arab Gulf Federation. British officials helped coordinate these efforts and now the time has arrived. In the capital of Bahrain, an elaborate flag raising ceremony took place. Leaders of the new nation told the assembled audience of dignitaries that the Arab Gulf Federation represented Arab unity and a bastion of defense against evil influences and enemies of the people. They also promised the crowd an era of unbelievable economic development that will make the people of the new state the envy of the world. At the end of the ceremony, the heads of states signed an agreement, along with the regional British officials, confirming the emergence of the Arab Gulf Federation."   #Major
 General_Strike.2.d:0 "In Bahrain, the general strike that has consumed the country over the past days appears to be nearing an end. The chief adviser to the King of Bahrain, Charles Belgrave has handed in his resignation. This was the principle demand of the strikes which were organized by the reformist National Unity Committee. The organization strongly believes in ending British influence in Bahrain and the resignation marks a victory for the group. Charles Belgrave has enjoyed his senior position in Bahrain for nearly thirty years and his resignation appears to have come after he realized the situation was escalating. The removal of Belgrave weakens British influence on the island but has demonstrated to the monarchy the threat of street power."
 Suez_Crisis_Gulf.50.d:0 "The situation in Bahrain has deteriorated as rioting engulfs the capital. Many have taken to the streets in angry protest to the Suez Crisis and British aggression against Egypt. The rioters are demanding the government remove British influence and believe Bahrain must support Egypt in their struggle. The lack of political openness combined with a disdain to the overt British presence on the island has exasperated the situation and the rioters are targeting not just British buildings but also stores that cater to foreigners. The government appears unable to contain the uprising as the King has held his military forces back, there is a fear that the soldiers may end up supporting the rioters and the government does not wish for the riots to escalate. Already the government has announced it will reduce the influence of British advisors in directing policies, but this has not ended the protests."
 Bab_Al_Bahrain.1.d:0 "The government of Bahrain formally opened the Bab Al Bahrain to enthusiastic crowds today. The beautiful monument will be the first public space in the small island nation and the government hopes it will provide better amenities to the citizens of Bahrain. The project was the brainchild of Charles Belgrave, the chief adviser to the King. Alongside banks, shops, and restaurants, the monument marks the entrance to the Manama market. In addition, the government plans to move its main buildings around the monument as well. Belgrave strongly believes the monument will help make Bahrain more attractive and facilitate an increase in trade to the island. The monument is being viewed quite favorably and seen as a symbol of the new, modern Bahrain by citizens."
 NUC.10.d:0 "Ever since the reformist National Unity Committee (NUC) emerged, it has been engaged in orchestrating strikes and riots. Although their objectives appear to be limited to improving worker rights, ending British influence, and combating sectarianism, it became clear the group harbors darker ambitions. Their recent general strike plunged the country into days of violent rioting that threatened the stability of Bahrain. The principle leaders of the NUC were rounded up and were being tried by a special court. Today that court reached its verdict and has decided to exile these leaders from Bahrain to a prison in Saint Helena for fourteen years. The British have agreed to keep these men and they will not be permitted to return until after their sentence. The government announced the verdict and proclaimed the destroyers of peace have been justly punished. The reaction on the street has been mute."

 General_Strike.1.d:0 "Ever since the National Unity Committee (NUC) emerged it has advocated for trade unions, an end of British influence, and an end to sectarianism. Their reformist agenda has allowed them great influence and in a bold move they have declared a general strike. The main objective of this strike is the removal of Charles Belgrave as chief adviser to the King. To many in Bahrain, Belgrave has symbolized the overt British influence over the country since he arrived nearly three decades ago. Early attempts by the police to contain or breakup protests have backfired. Riots are slowly emerging and as the violence escalates. So far the government has refused to accept the NUC demands but the government certainly knows the group now forms a potent threat to government policy."
 Bahrainian_Revolution.1.d:0 "The Suez Crisis inflamed Arab passions in Bahrain as thousands took to the streets to protest British actions against Egypt. The protesters pelted stones at British officials in the country and ransacked British-run buildings across the capital. The riots have been accompanied by strikes organized by the National Union Committee. However, over the past few days, Arab Nationalist revolutionaries approached the rioters and yesterday turned them against the ruling monarchy. The rioters, now revolutionaries turned on the government, demanding an elected legislature and a new regime for Bahrain. Protesters began seizing government buildings and radio stations, declaring the people must end the reactionary monarchy and liberate Bahrain from Britain. The King deployed his forces to quell the riots, claiming the NUC was a front for foreign leftist influence, but most troops joined the protesters by the morning the country had been seized by the revolutionaries."
 Bahrainian_Revolution.2.d:0 "For nearly three decades, British advisor Charles Belgrave has acted as chief adviser to the monarchy in Bahrain. Under his influence, Bahrain initiated a series of social and economic reforms designed to modernize the country, though often angering traditionalists. Similarly, his over sized influence was seen by most citizens of Bahrain as a symbol of continued British influence and control over the country. During the recent riots and revolution, many blame Belgrave for pushing the King to violently suppress the protests and hold him responsible for the civilian casualties suffered. Charles Belgrave surrendered to the revolutionaries once it became clear the monarchy had lost power and was soon publicly executed. The revolutionaries claimed his death marked liberation, but the action is being widely condemned across the region and world. Many in London are this turn of events and it remains to be seen how the British will react to this provocation."
 Bahrainian_Revolution.3.d:0 "The news of the execution of Charles Belgrave by the revolutionaries has seen mass panic grip the British population on the island. To alleviate this tension and prevent further violence against its citizens, the British government announced a full withdrawal of its forces and a full evacuation of its citizens. British subjects are flooding to British military facilities for protection as the British military has begun sending flights to evacuate citizens. Once the British civilians are safely evacuated, British forces will follow shortly after. British subjects and forces had played a major role in helping the oil industry and defense of Bahrain, their unilateral withdrawal will certainly hinder the economy."
