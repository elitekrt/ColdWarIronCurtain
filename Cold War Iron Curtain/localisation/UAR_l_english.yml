 UAR_Restore_Boghdadi_as_Vice_President_desc:0 "One of the original members of the Free Officers movement and an important figure in the 1952 revolution, Abdel Latif Boghdadi was Vice-President of Egypt during the early years of Nasser’s Presidency. However disagreement over what he thought was Nasser adopting more soviet style economic policy and disagreement over creating a closer relationship with the United States led to Boghdadi resigning his office. However now with the recent political and economic liberalization efforts, President Nasser more closely aligns with Boghdadi’s ideals. We should return Boghdadi as rightful Vice-President and right hand of Nasser."

 UAR_Keep_Sadat_Vice_President_desc:0 "Anwar Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers movement and has always been a close confidant of President Nasser. Many see him as Nasser’s political protege and the most likely candidate to succeed Nasser should anything happen to him. He has faithfully and loyally served Nasser as Vice-President throughout the years, and although he has disagreed with Nasser on some occasions there is no reason to shake up the administration by replacing him."

 UAR_Accept_the_Rogers_Plan_desc:0 "President Nasser has agreed to the proposal by American Secretary of State William Rogers. The plan is a comprehensive outline for a path to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict, and although some decry it as too pro-Israeli, President Nasser has seen this as an opportunity to regain the Sinai, allow the Palestinians a chance to return home, and increase Egypt’s standing with the major powers."
 
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.100.d:0 "The Ministry of Defense has recently received a proposal from junior intelligence officers to implement an upgrade of the telecommunication capabilities of government and military institutions. The proposal notes the current system is decades old and according to analysis, appears vulnerable to enemy interception. More significantly, they note a high stress on the system, like during wartime may lead to breakdowns which would severely limit the ability of commanders to direct forces. When senior officers and ministers were act their opinion, they stated the current system is more than capable and the proposal appears to be an effort by these junior officers to elevate their position and profit from the process. Indeed, it is noted the upgrade proposed would be quite costly and may impact the acquisition of vital equipment for the military. With this in mind, the government must consider whether to approve the proposal or not to."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.1.d:0 "The Israeli forces launched their pre-emptive invasion of the Sinai. The Egyptian Army quickly found itself facing a concentrated attack in the northern and central Sinai, against their expectations. Rapidly moving Israeli ground units were flanking and overwhelming Egyptian units on the border. Within hours of hostilities beginning, the Egyptian forces were in almost total disarray, with units being cutoff and communication systems becoming overwhelmed. The senior leadership in Cairo does not appear to grasp the situation on the ground and now it appears the resistance of the Egyptian Army is collapsing. Many forces are already retreating to the Suez."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.2.d:0 "We must soon call the leaders of Syria and Jordan to inform them of the current situation in the Sinai. Some advisors believe we should inform them the truth of the situations. That we have taken heavy losses in material and soldiers. More importantly, that the situation in the Sinai has deteriorated to into a full route for our forces. Other advisors fear that revealing such news will cause them to betray the Arab cause and leave us to face the Zionist enemy alone. They want us to dismiss Israeli claims of victories as propaganda and state we have inflicted heavy losses on their aircraft and our forces are about to enter the borders of the Zionist nation itself. Doing so will push them to intervene and reduce the pressure on our forces. With the time to make the call approaching we must decide whether to tell the truth or not."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.3.d:0 "With news that our brothers in Egypt face the Zionists in a brutal struggle, we have decided to launch our own assaults on the Zionists. This will liberate Arab lands and put enough pressure on their borders that the corrupt house of lies and false nation will soon collapse. The military commanders on the ground believe the enemy is concentrated in the Sinai and our forces will easily overwhelm the weak forces on our borders. Victory will be decisively achieved. Although initial reports indicate a heavy resistance from the enemy, we expect news of victories to follow soon. We are upholding our sacred vows to the Arab people."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.5.d:0 "Our combined offensive into the Zionist homeland has proven to be a magnificent success. Their soldiers and people lacked the resolve to resist the bravery and skill of our brave soldiers and pilots. People have taken to the streets across the Arab World in celebration of our great victory. Thousands of Arabs who had been displaced during the Nakba eagerly await the opportunity for a return to liberated land. For the moment the joint Arab military command will continue to function to deal with prisoners, patrolling the ceasefire line, and ensuring the Zionists do not try any tricks. But at the moment it is clear to the world we have triumphed."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.8.d:0 "Our brothers in Egypt informed us of the true situation in the Sinai. We are aware of the setbacks being suffered by them and the continued Zionist aggression. Many of our advisors are urging us to remain neutral and not intervene in the conflict. They fear the Zionists are far more dangerous than thought and the time is not right. Perhaps in time we can come together, better prepared and ready for action. Others, however, are urging us to act in the name of Arab unity to save the situation. They point out the people will be furious if we fail to aid our brothers in Egypt. They also note the military situation may turn insurmountable if we delay action. The decision we make to intervene or not may well decide the destiny of the region."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.17.d:0 "The cowardly Zionist attempt to destroy our Air Force ended in failure for them. This naked act of aggression cannot go uncalled for. The leadership approved orders for our brave forces in the Sinai to take the battle to the enemy and invade the land they stole in 1948. The officers and soldiers are confident and in high spirits following the recent success. They have waited years for this order and the time is right. We expect the Zionists to resist but are confident that with the initiative our forces will overwhelm any opposition. With our airpower preserved this will greatly aid our advance."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.18.d:0 "Following the failed preemptive strike by Zionists against the Egyptian Air Force, our Arab brother responded by invading from the Sinai. Without air superiority or the element of surprise, the Zionists face a daunting challenge. The popular mood among the people is that we must act in solidarity and use our forces to break the enemy lines and secure a victory. With our own air power and land forces added to the struggle, this may prove the decisive action and avenge the humiliation of the Nakba. After close consultations, it was agreed to act. Within hours of this decision, the brave Arab soldiers of Syria and Jordan went into action."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.21.d:0 "The President in Cairo received a message from Eilat that the Zionist fortress had fallen. This marks the biggest achievement of or armed forces in this conflict. The Arab World has always looked up to us to be its Prussia and so far, we have exceeded those expectations. Through toughness and skill our forces have expertly advanced into the western Negev desert, liberating Arab lands and Bedouin tribes. From there we moved towards the Zionist city of Eilat. Its Red Sea port and airfield are essential for the Zionist economy and its loss is not just a major economic blow but will leave their economy vulnerable in the future. Already the military commander has been authorized to establish a military government in Eilat and keep its Zionists residents under control to prevent any fifth columns from emerging."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.25.d:0 "Ever since the Nakba the Zionists have engaged in a vicious campaign of violence and oppression against the Arabs. They interfere in our affairs and inflict pain on innocents, especially those who were expelled from their ancient homes. In recent years we have built an impressive war machine, the pride of the Arab World. In addition, the current international situation and the fervor of our people favors action and the time has come to prove that we are the Prussia of the Arabs. After receiving orders from Cairo, our powerful military forces in the Sinai sprang into action and began their advance into occupied Arab lands long exploited by the Zionists. Although the international community will not appreciate this action, we have taken the element of surprise and initiative from the enemy, which will no doubt help us overcome the Zionist defenses."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.35.d:0 "The Israeli government has agreed to capitulate to Syrian demands on water rights for the Jordan River. This was the principle demand of Syria following its victory during the recent war with Israel. The Syrian military joined with fellow Arab states Jordan and Egypt to defeat Israel. Although the Israelis were able to prevent a total capitulation, it was forced to make territorial and economic concessions with its foes. For Syria, the dispute over water rights has dominated its conflict with Israel. Both states long accused the other of trying to steal water which is essential for both economies. Syria hopes with the rights now secured following its victory, it will be able to have an agricultural revolution. In Israel there is widespread fear this concession will lead to water shortages and economic disaster."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.36.d:0 "Although the Jordanians appeared to be the most reluctant of the Arab states involved in the recent war with Israel, it did commit its forces and emerged victorious in the conflict, alongside its allies. Although Israel avoided a complete capitulation, its military defeat means it must make economic and territorial concessions to its opponents. After intense discussions, the Jordanians announced Israel would cede Jezreel and the area around it. The Jordanians claim they have liberated the Arabs, especially the Arab Christians of the area and their holy lands from the oppressive Israeli occupation regime. News of the agreement is seeing many Arab refugees from 1948 move towards the border in order to return home. Residents wishing to remain with Israel are being asked to either leave or accept the new Jordanian administration."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.37.d:0 "The United Arab Republic (UAR) signed its final agreement to end the recent war between it and Israel. In the agreement, Israel has agreed to cede the western Negev to occupying UAR forces. During the war, UAR forces had advanced as far as Eilat, but a counteroffensive before the ceasefire saw Israel reclaim Eilat. This last-minute victory ensured Israel only ended up having to cede a thinly populated desert region instead of losing a vital city and port. The UAR is portraying the agreement as a total victory, claiming it had liberated the Arab Bedouin in the area and are now placed to punish the Israeli homeland if it tries future aggressions. Many in Cairo took to the streets to celebrate the announcement, but many observers note the Israelis will likely be relieved that they kept Eilat which may prove vital to its post-war reconstruction."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.38.d:0 "The United Arab Republic (UAR) signed its final agreement to end the recent war between it and Israel. In the agreement, Israel has agreed to cede the western Negev and Eilat to occupying UAR forces. During the war, UAR and Israeli forces engaged in brutal battles, but the UAR forces were able to advance and capture Eilat. A late counterattack by Israel to recapture the city ended in failure and many in Israel view the loss of Eilat as catastrophic. For the UAR, the mood is ecstatic as people have taken to the street. The UAR government announced the agreement confirms its victory. They claim to have liberated occupied Arab lands and Bedouin residents of its new territories. It also added that by controlling Eilat, the UAR now has a bridge to the rest of the Arab World."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.39.d:0 "Despite their extensive propaganda campaign, Egypt cannot hide the reality that they have suffered a crushing defeat in the hands of Israel. Israeli forces now control the Sinai and occupy the Palestinian Arabs in Gaza. The Egyptian military, despite its prewar claims of superiority proved incapable of handling the Israeli military which utilized effective tactics, coordination, and skill to achieve its stunning victory. Many in Israel support the occupation of the Sinai, believing it offers Israel a buffer from which to monitor and control future Egyptian aggression. Already the Egyptian government and its allies are condemning the Israeli occupation, claiming it to be illegal and a threat to future peace in the region. Regardless, Israel remains triumphant and its gains unchallenged." #Israeli Victory Against the UAR (Global)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.40.d:0 "The Israeli government today confirmed its victory over Syria by announcing it will continue to hold the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights and its difficult terrain appeared to be the main advantage for Syrian forces on the defensive. However, during the recent war, Israeli forces managed to overwhelm and capture the area from the Syrian military. Syrian forces failed to successfully counterattack or halt the Israeli forces. With the ceasefire it became clear the Israelis had taken the Golan and Syrian military efforts had largely ended. With this victory, many in Israel believe the nation has gained a natural defensive border to better protect the country from future aggression by Syria." #Israeli Victory Against Syria (Global)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.41.d:0 "The Jordanian government acknowledged that the West Bank remains under the occupation of Israeli forces. This confirms the major victory achieved by Israel in the recent war. Israeli forces were able to defeat the Jordanians and secured the West Bank in order to better support its other gains and ensure the security of Jerusalem. The West Bank is home to many Arab Palestinians and is currently under an Israeli military government. Israelis are said to be overjoyed with these victories. There is also immense international pressure on Israel and the Arab states to not see a repeat of the refugee crisis of 1948. Many residents in the West Bank are currently unsure about the future. The Jordanians are largely humiliated and are now east of the Jordan River. In Israel many feel the country now has space for the nation to grow in prosperity." #Israeli Victory Against Jordan (Global)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.0.d:0 "The recent Arab provocations in the Sinai along with the closing of the Straits of Tiran saw the Prime Minister call a meeting of senior cabinet and military officials to discuss a response. At the meeting the intelligence agency reported it did not believe America would intervene to resolve the recent tensions. This provoked several senior generals, including Yitzhak Rabin, Arial Sharon and Moshe Dayan to urge for a preemptive strike before the enemy struck first. The Prime Minister responded by urging calm and stating his belief that America would help resolve the situation. The generals are almost rebellious in their criticism of the Prime Minister and his stance. It is up to the government to decide on implementing a preemptive strike or to hold off and hope the situation deescalates. The planned initial strike would be a bold all-out attack to destroy the Egyptian Air Force codenamed Operation Moked."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.31.d:0 "Despite the boldness of the plan and the immense skills of our pilots, Operation Moked has ended in failure. It appears our aircraft lacked the element of surprise as Egyptian observers and radar crews were able to communicate the movement of our fighters. Efforts to interrupt or overwhelm communication systems had failed. Although the speed of our attack did leave many Arab planes out in the open, heavy anti-aircraft fire and the scrambling of several enemy planes greatly disrupted the attack. Many of the bombs missed their targets and efforts to conduct strafing runs on enemy fighters on the ground were not possible or accurate. We lost several fighters and did not inflict the damage Operation Focus called for. This failure now sees us at war with an Arab enemy possessing an intact Air Force and now we must fight to protect our airspace and people." #Operation Moked Failure
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.30.d:0 "The close cooperation between the Air Force and intelligence services resulted in the brilliant success of Operation Focus. Our fighters moved under Arab radar coverage while intelligence operatives disrupted enemy communications, preventing any warning for our operation. Once the planes reached the targeted airfields, they commenced bombing and strafing runs. The Egyptian defense was quite lacking as most planes were out on the runways and hangers did not appear to be built to withstand bombs. From intelligence intercepts and photographs taken by our attacking fighters, we can confirm hundreds of Arab planes were destroyed. Many of these runways are severely damaged as well. Enemy anti-air forces had no warning and by the time they got into position, we had already returned home. Our brave pilots are already planning follow up strikes against Arab military targets in the Sinai to help our ground forces succeed in their operations.” #Operation moked Success
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.4.d:0 "The Arabs in Syria sought to take advantage of our crisis and drive a dagger into our homeland. The enemy forces lack the discipline, skill, and training of our own forces but did make some advances on the border. In response, we have marshalled our forces and launched a counterattack against them. With our air superiority the commanders on the ground are confident the advances made by the enemy will be reversed. Intercepted communications indicate the Arabs are nervous and unsure, they will not be able to resist us as we push them back." #Israeli Perspective Counter-Attacking Syria
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.41.d:0 "The Arabs in Jordan, pushed into action by the other Arabs, launched an attack into our lands. This enemy proved difficult during our struggle for independence, but we are much stronger now and they are not acting with conviction. We have marshalled our forces and launched a counterattack against them. With our air superiority the commanders on the ground are confident the advances made by the enemy will be reversed. We do not expect that they will be able to resist us and are confident they will be pushed back from their minor gains." #Israeli Perspective Counter-Attacking Jordan
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.6.d:0 "Despite the confidence of our commanders and the soundness of our strategy, our counter-attack against the Arab intruders has failed. They have proven to be stubborn defenders and despite our clear advantages, have positioned themselves well enough to counter our moves. The cabinet has noted its disappointment with the military for their failure to achieve the results expected. Across Israel there is a sense of disappointment and fear of what will happen now that the enemy remains in our lands. An emergency meeting of the cabinet and military is expected soon to consider options." #Failed Counter-Attack (Israeli Perspective)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.7.d:0 "The dangerous Arab designs against us has been clear for a long time. A delay of action only risks them organizing and striking us at the time of their choosing. After much consideration, the military leadership presented the cabinet with a plan to pre-emptively neutralize the Arabs in Syria and Jordan. Despite the international condemnation which may result from this action, the survival of the nation is at stack. The cabinet recognized this and approved the plan. This morning the brave soldiers and pilots of the Israeli Defense Force moved into action. They have crossed both borders effectively and the nation looks forward to hearing positive news from the offensives." #Israel Perspective Launch Offensives Against Syria/Israel (Jordan and Syria did not attack first)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.15.d:0 "The West Bank has fallen to our victorious soldiers after intense fighting. The cabinet approved an order giving the military commander of the region total administrative control and placing the West Bank under military government. The seizing of the West Bank was not in the original planning, but as our forces were mopping up Arab resistance in the area it became clear controlling the West Bank and having a defensible border in the Jordan river are essential for the security of our other gains in the area. The region possesses a large Arab population, but with the right security in place this should not pose a major problem. Most importantly the Old City of Jerusalem and Temple Mount are now in our hands, for the first time in two thousand years, Temple Mount is in Jewish hands." #Israeli Perspective Seizes the West Bank
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.151.d:0 "The cabinet had fiercely debated whether to assault the Golan Heights occupied by the Arabs. There was a fear that the difficult terrain would mean heavy casualties for little gain against an entrenched foe. However, the lack of resolve and ability shown by the enemy made it clear the Golan was perhaps not as dangerous as originally thought. Under the urging and orders of Moshe Dayan, two brigades launched the assault and after day of stiff resistance, they overwhelmed the enemy. The Arabs failed to counter-attack and it is clear we now control the Golan Heights. Our forces have begun digging in and ensuring we will not be easily dislodged." #Israeli Perspective Seizes Golan Heights
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.19.d:0 "The Arabs to the north have advanced into our country. We know they lack the ability or tact of our own soldiers, but the sheer number of enemy forces and armor overwhelmed the initial border defenses. Now our commanders have assessed the situation and this morning our forces began a counterattack to drive the Arabs back to Damascus. Although the military is confident, they did note to the cabinet that our troops will struggle to call in heavy air support or concentrate in large numbers. The lack of air superiority means many of our fighters are committed to defending the air space. It also means our forces risk enemy air attack if they concentrate into too large a force in the open. However, despite these challenges, victory will no doubt be achieved." #Israeli Perspective Counter-Attacking Syria (OP Focus Failed)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.191.d:0 "The Arabs to the east have advanced into our country. We know they lack the resolve of our own soldiers, but the advantages of concentrating their forces against one front and their experience allowed them to initially overwhelm our thin border defenses. Now our commanders have assessed the situation and this morning our forces began a counterattack to drive the Arabs back across the Jordan. Although the military is confident, they did note to the cabinet that our troops will struggle to call in heavy air support or concentrate in large numbers. The lack of air superiority means many of our fighters are committed to defending the air space. It also means our forces risk enemy air attack if they concentrate into too large a force in the open. In the terrain we face, having airpower to support land advances would have been much appreciated." #Israeli Perspective Counter-Attacking Jordan (OP Focus Failed)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.19.d:0 "The Arab military forces in the Sinai launched an invasion into the homeland. As they are by far the largest Arab force it is of little surprise that they were able to penetrate the border and advance. They are moving in large numbers and are challenging the skies for air superiority. However, our military leaders recently began a series of counterattacks to halt and eventually drive the Arabs back to the border. Although we face the threat of air attacks on our forces, it is believed the training, skill, and ability of our soldiers will allow them to outmaneuver and defeat this invasion force." #Israeli Perspective Counter-Attack into Sinai
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.22.d:0 "During an emergency cabinet meeting with senior military leaders, it was decided to immediately authorize a counterattack to retake Eilat from the Arab invaders. Although the fighting is quite desperate and our forces are largely committed, we cannot risk losing Eilat. The port in Eilat connects us with Asia and Africa. Its location on the Red Sea gives us a flexibility in terms of sea trade that is essential to prevent Arab blockade efforts. Strategically it also separates the Arabs in Egypt from the rest of the Arab World and its loss will greatly aid their efforts against us. The planned attack hopes to target two weak points in the enemy defenses, leading to a breakthrough which will see Eilat surrounded and then fortified by our forces. The attack began an hour ago." #Launch Counter-Attack to Retake Eilat (Israeli Perspective)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.23.d:0 "After desperate fighting, our troops were able to secure Eilat, its port, and airfield from Arab forces. It is a testament to the ability of our people that despite the recent hardships and challenges, we were able to launch a vital assault and reclaim Eilat. Our forces were able to strike the enemy at two identified weak points, push through and then surround Eilat. After a brief fight the small Arab force in the city surrendered, and we established strong defensive lines protecting the city. Since we first established Eilat it has been our window to Africa and Asia. Regardless of the setbacks taken in this conflict, we will never forget the bravery of our forces in Eilat and how they saved the post-war future of the country." # Eilat Retaken (Israeli Perspective)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.24.d:0 "The cabinet was recently informed that the Eilat attack has failed. Although our forces managed to hit the two weak points, one of those positions resisted stiffly enough for reinforcements to arrive, blunting that attack. The other force did breakthrough and despite their maneuverability and initial successes, they were not strong enough to complete the encirclement of Eilat and were stopped. The attack has cost us vital equipment and manpower, but it was agreed we had no choice. The loss of Eilat makes the post-war situation much more dire for our nation but in the end we will persevere and always remember the brave sacrifices of our soldiers as they desperately sought to save Eilat from ruin." # Eilat Counter-Offensive Fails
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.26.d:0 "The Arab military forces in the Sinai proved their danger to the homeland with their recent aggression. With their forces still poised to further threaten our people, the cabinet recently approved the launching of an offensive into the Sinai to neutralize this threat. Clearing the Sinai of this force and destroying their capacity to wage offensive war will greatly ensure the future of our nation. This morning our forces advanced, quickly crossing the border. It is hoped the use of flanking maneuvers and advancing along routes unanticipated by the enemy will lead to breakthroughs and victory." #Israeli Counter-Offensive into the Sinai (Israel Perspective)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.27.d:0 "The offensive into the Sinai has unfortunately stalled in failure. Efforts to outflank and destroy Arab formations did not materialize as the resistance proved much stiffer than anticipated. Although our forces did have early successes and there was hope the Arab forces would fall apart from the initial blows, the enemy held firm at enough places to blunt the advance. Although they could not match the maneuverability and skills of our forces, they were able to bring concentrated firepower to bear and this proved decisive in blunting our forces. The stalled attack cost our forces heavily in equipment and personnel." #Failed Israeli Offensive in the Sinai (Israel Perspective)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.28.d:0 "After brief fighting, our forces are the undisputed masters of the Sinai and Gaza. In the Sinai we faced a sizeable Arab military opposition, however, their resistance and resolved collapsed very early on. Our troops and their officers were able to use speed and maneuverability to outflank, divide, and destroy enemy formations piecemeal. Our victories broke the resistance of our opponents who eventually fled, abandoning the Sinai which we now possess. Gaza, with its large, hostile Arab population was also quickly secured, with any resistance crushed almost immediately. It is now under military government to ensure peace. With the Sinai and Gaza under our occupation we now have a buffer to protect us from the Cairo threat and now control a hostile Arab population that can no longer be mobilized against us." #Israel Seizes the Sinai and Gaza (Israel Perspective)
