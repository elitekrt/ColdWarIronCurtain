 Iranian_Revolution.1.d:0 "The Iranian government hoped that the exile of Ayatollah Khomeini from Iran would isolate him from his followers and break his influence in the country. However, from his home in Iraq, the Ayatollah continues to rail against the Shah and its alliance with the United States. Hopes that his years of exile would cause his support to wither proved to be a mistake. When his followers visit Iraq, often on pilgrimage to the holy cities, they bring back audio cassette tapes of Ayatollah Khomeini and his sermons. These tapes have become incredibly popular in the black market and he has not only expanded his number of followers but is also a nationally known figure. Even the more secular Iranian opponents of the Shah respect the fiery rhetoric of Khomeini and his steadfast belief that the monarchy must end."
 Iranian_Revolution.2.d:0 "The young sociologist Ali Shariati has become a revolutionary ideologue for Iranians of all political orientations. In his widely popular tapes, he manages to combine elements of Marxism, Shia Islam, and Iranian nationalism. He criticizes the other major post-World War II revolutionary movements for their secularism. Instead he argues for Iran, the Shia faith must be embraced as it is historically an activist faith. His argument allows religious Iranians to comfortably engage in revolutionary politics without fear of compromising their religious beliefs. Although the Iranian government has tried aggressively to suppress these tapes, they have spread far and are popular in Madrassahs and University campuses alike."
 Iranian_Revolution.3.d:0 "The Shah of Iran formally approved the decision of Prime Minister (whoever is the Prime Minister at the time) to merge the two legal political parties and unite to form the Rastakhiz (Resurgence) Party. The new party requires all Iranians to participate as members and will act as a force of national unity and development. There will no longer be political disunity in the Majlis, and a new youth wing will help spread the party across Iran. The move is seen as the Shah consolidating his absolute power and has alienated the professional and politically conscious communities. The requirement of membership and the dues it entails has alienated the Bazaari community who are resistant to paying the government or abiding to their regulations. For the Shah, he has secured complete political control and now the Majlis will pass legislation and reforms without debates or delays."
 Iranian_Revolution.4.d:0 "In the latest attempt by the Shah to impose himself over the clergy, he announced the Persian calendar will officially replace the Islamic calendar in Iran. The decision has sparked outrage among not just clergy but across social groups in Iran who view Islam as an important part of their identity. For the clergy, this is the latest effort by the Shah who has also expanded Theology Departments in the secular Universities as a means to spread his accepted version of Islam. Security agencies informed the Shah that many low rank Imams are condemning the decision in their Friday sermons."
 Iranian_Revolution.5.d:0 "In Mashhad the government completed a redevelopment project to beautify the Shrine of Imam Reza and the city. The bazaars around the site were demolished and new roads were constructed around the site. The actions provoked violence and angry protests, including the bombing of several construction vehicles. The bazaari people were upset over the destruction of their buildings and how the project has separated them from the local clergy. The local clergy too were angered by how the project has isolated them from the masses. For the government this result can only be seen as a success. The area is now visually appealing and more organized. More importantly, the operation has broken the physical connection of the bazaari operators and the clergy."
 Iranian_Revolution.6.d:0 "The National Front is spearheading a campaign to send open letters of grievances to the Shah and government. They are demanding more democracy for Iran and a reduced role for the Shah. Many Iranian liberal politicians and intellectuals have participated. These letters are largely being ignored by the government, however, the international reputation of Iran is being negatively affected. Increasingly there are reports on the lack of political freedoms in Iran despite its extensive modernization campaign. These letters are also pushing Iranian students, especially those studying abroad to highlight the problems they see in their homeland."
 Iranian_Revolution.7.d:0 "Lawyers in Iran have staged a series of protests in Tehran. The lawyers are protesting recent changes to judicial procedures that make it easier for the government to detain dissidents. Such changes only benefit state agencies and stack the legal system against Iranian citizens. In addition to demanding these changes be reversed, the lawyers are also calling on the Iranian government and judiciary to more closely adhere to the rule of law as laid out by the constitution. They argue for years the government and security agencies have flaunted legal procedures and laws to carry out their agenda. The government has dismissed these lawyers as foreign agents and insist Iran has among the strongest judicial systems in the region."
 Iranian_Revolution.8.d:0 "The Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, Ali Shariati passed away from an apparent heart attack in England. His sudden death at such a young age is fueling skepticism across Iran that he had been murdered by SAVAK, the government secret police. The Paris-educated Shariati was deeply influenced by post-colonial revolutionary movements as a way to liberate Iran but opposed their secular nature. Instead, he noted Shia Islam was an activist faith, that when combined with Marxism and Iranian patriotism would allow Iranians to preserve their identity and liberate themselves from oppression. His core message of allowing Iranians to maintain their faith and still conduct revolutionary actions made him a popular influence across the country. His sermons and tapes being huge hits among university students and religious activists alike. His death is a major blow to Iranian revolutionaries, however, his tapes are now more popular than ever, inspiring many Iranians to believe in the legitimacy of revolutionary action."
 Iranian_Revolution.9.d:0 "Heavy government spending, especially on luxury goods and the military, along with ambitious social programs have put great strains on the economy. Inflation is running rampant and the oil boom has only fueled this extravagant spending. More troubling, the wealth gap in the country has significantly widened as elites have managed to amass fortunes during this period. To combat the economic woes facing Iran, the government announced new austerity measures meant to bring the inflation under control. However, these new measures are likely to mostly effected the poor urban populations of the country. Experts warn the impact of austerity on the working industrial workers may cause wide discontent with the government and disruptions in industrial production."
 Iranian_Revolution.10.d:0 "Amnesty International published a damning report on the Shah and his government. They accuse the government of engaging in gross violations of human rights, including the torture of suspects and arrests without due process. This is the first time the human rights organization published a report on Iran. The Iranian government denies the claims that human rights violations are state policy and insists any violations are isolated incidents. They add the report is biased by its reliance on anti-government individuals. In Iran the report has started rumors that the United States has withdrawn its support for the Shah, many assuming Amnesty is an arm of the American government. 
 Iranian_Revolution.11.d:0 "When news reached of the planned visit by the Shah and his wife to the White House, thousands of Iranian students began converging to the capital. They wanted to demonstrate against the Shah and his government. To counter these protestors, the Iranian government bussed in military officers and cadets along with government supporters currently in the United States to counter the protest. When the Shah reached the White House, he faced thousands of protestors. The counter-protestors then started attacking, leading to clashes. As the President welcomed the Shah outside, the local police dropped tear gas, which ended up reaching the Shah and the President, forcing both men to rush into the White House. In Iran, reports of the incident sparked rumors that the CIA purposely tear gassed the Shah, further confirming the growing belief in the country that he has lost American backing."
 Iranian_Revolution.12.d:0 "A leading government newspaper published a bizarre article regarding the Ayatollah Khomeini. The article published over the top allegations regarding Khomeini from his sexual orientation, his nationality, and his religious devotion. It also accused him of being a British agent bent on selling Iran to imperialists and communists. The article was condemned across the country as even the most secular Iranians recognize Khomeini as a man of faith and principles. Among the supporters of Khomeini, the reaction was rage. Religious students in the holy city of Qom, joined by bazaaris and other Khomeini supporters, began protests over the article. The police intervened and this led to violent clashes. The government claim two protestors were killed though rumors claim the police opened fired and the casualties were higher than fifty. As per Shia custom, the memorial services for the dead protestors will be held forty days after their death."
 Iranian_Revolution.13.d:0 "Across Iran, memorial services (called chehelom) were held to commemorate those killed by police during the Qom protests. The violent protests began following the publication of an incendiary article in the leading government newspaper about Ayatollah Khomeini. In the forty days after the protests, supporters of Khomeini and other Shia religious leaders were able to organize Mosques across Iran to hold services for the dead. At the end the services, tens of thousands took to the street to condemn the government and the Shah. The chehelom protests resulted in several more deaths, and there are already plans to hold similar protests forty days from now. The government must decide whether to work with moderate clergy, offer minor concessions, and ride out the public outrage. Or if a stronger, military response is necessary to end the protests and restore stability to Iran."
 Iranian_Revolution.14.d:0 "The cycle of chehelom protests has gone on for months now, hurting the economy and stability of Iran. However, the last few cycles of protests have seen a steep drop in the number of participants. The government claimed the last protest was small enough that security forces easily controlled the situation. The success of the government can be seen in its outreach to moderate Shia clergy, gradual liberalization on the right to protests, and negotiations with protestors. He has promised democratic elections next year, placating secularist opponents, and signed orders to reduce corruption, especially from the royal family. Although protestors continued to take casualties each protest day, those arrested were tried in civil courts. Allegedly corrupt officials were also being dismissed and the Shah also replaced the head of SAVAK with a moderate general. The Shah appears to have survived this latest period of civil unrest."
 Iranian_Revolution.15.d:0 "The nation of Iran is in mourning following a shocking attack in Abadan. A group of unidentified men lit the Cinema Rex theater on fire after barring the doors to prevent any escape from the patrons. The fire spread rapidly and in the end over four hundred people died in the blaze. The Iranian government is blaming Islamic Marxists for the attack. However, the protestors and opponents of the Shah accuse SAVAK, the state secret police of carrying out the attack to drive a wedge between secular and religious protestors. Iranians who had been on the fence over the recent intensification of protests are generally believing the protestors claims, and the Iranian government is preparing for a surge of new protests across the country. Now many Iranians believe the Shah and his government is complacent in the devastating Cinema Rex arson attack."
 Iranian_Revolution.16.d:0 "The anti-Pahlavi protestors, whose numbers swelled after the Cinema Rex arson attack was blamed on the government, gained another boost as the holy month of Ramadan begins. Anti-government clergy are able to inspire many in their congregations to join the protests as an almost religious obligation to their faith and nation. Any hopes the government had at stabilizing this period of unrest appears to be disintegrating rapidly. Much like earlier protests, inexperienced soldiers and police are firing into crowds, despite orders not to use violence to disperse the unrest. More troubling is news that the moderate clergy appears to be losing control and influence over the younger clergy and the population."
 Iranian_Revolution.17.d:0 "Eid al-Fitr, the celebration that marks the end of Ramadan, was meant to be an opportunity for the Shah to cool down the recent unrest. The Iranian government granted permits for open air prayers in Tehran. Crowds of over half a million citizens attended and after the prayers, clergy directed them to march through central Tehran. The crowds turned into an anti-Shah protest, with chants for the return of Ayatollah Khomeini and calls for an Islamic Republic. This marked a radicalization in the protests as Khomeini is adamant in the removal of the Shah, not just political reforms. The Shah allegedly watched the protests from his helicopter. Concerned he assembled his top officials and must decide his course of action. He can declare martial law and have the military resolve the situation. His other option is to call the secular opposition, negotiate his abdication and accept a new constitution that curtails the monarchy."
 Iranian_Revolution.18.d:0 "The Shah announced martial law in twelve cities across Iran. Protests will be banned, and the severe General Gholam-Ali Oveissi will oversee the martial law administration. In a continuation of the vacillating stance of the Shah he promised continued liberalization after the martial law is lifted. Several thousand protestors defied the orders and clashed with Iranian soldiers, who fired into the crowds. Dozens were killed and despite claims by General Oveissi that his troops were fired upon. Many in the country are blaming the military for indiscriminate violence and are calling the events Black Friday. News of continued violence and pictures of dead protestors have hardened the population against the Shah. The Shah criticized the military and has ordered them to stand down in future protests, but even the most moderate opposition members are unwilling to hold open talks with the Shah."
 Iranian_Revolution.19.d:0 "The aftermath of Black Friday has seen many Iranians shift from wanting a reduced monarchy to an end to the Pahlavi dynasty. However, adding to the difficulties of the Shah is the recent announcement by Iranian workers of a general strike in solidarity with the protestors. The Iranian oil industry, critical to its economic clout is virtually shut down as are most industries. Workers are organizing national strike committees to ensure the economic impact of the strikes are felt by the government. The Shah has refused advice to deploy troops to break up the strikes and has instead expanded their wages. Despite his actions, the workers at the moment remain committed to stand with the protestors."
 Iranian_Revolution.20.d:0 "A desperate Shah requested the Iraqi government remove Ayatollah Khomeini from Najaf. The Iranian government believes his removal will prevent him from trying to secretly enter Iran or spread his dangerous messages to his supporters within Iran. The Iraqi government complied, fearing Khomeini may inflame their own population, and the Ayatollah left for a Paris suburb. However, hopes that Khomeini would be silenced or sidelined were quickly dashed as Iranian dissidents and exiles abroad have converged to visit the Ayatollah. In addition, Paris has an extensive media presence which has made it easier for Khomeini to address Iranians protesting the Shah. Ayatollah Khomeini has also held talks with leading secular opposition leaders who have agreed to support his call for the overthrow of the Shah and an Islamic presence within the next government."
 Iranian_Revolution.21.d:0 "With anti-government protests raging daily across Iran and the economy at a virtual standstill, several senior generals approached the Shah. They demanded he impower a military committee to take over security and administer the martial law. They claim the indecisiveness of the government has only acted to fuel the unrest and the situation was deteriorating rapidly. The Shah has agreed but must decide which faction of the military to empower. He can pick the moderates, who will likely try to reign in the clashes and be more conciliatory, or empower the hardliners who believe a strong, firm approach is necessary."
 Iranian_Revolution.22.d:0 "The Shah of Iran addressed the nation recently. He acknowledged the corruptions and mistakes of his regime, pledging to correct them. In addition, he stated the current military regime was temporary and he would open talks with the opposition on forming a coalition government along with democratic reforms. The speech was intended to calm the protests and end the national strike crippling the economy, but it appears to have only made the protestors believe the regime will soon collapse. The military government is quite upset with the announcement as it undermines their position and potential actions. Considering his calls for restraint, many in the military believe they can no longer complete a complete crackdown even if they wanted to."
 Iranian_Revolution.23.d:0 "The military government expanded martial law to Khuzestan recently. The vital province holds most of the oil production in Iran and its workers have been on strike for over a month. Protest marches have greatly reduced, and the navy sent personnel to break the strike of oil workers. Oil production has returned to the pre-revolutionary period and is providing some relief to the ailing Iranian economy. In other news, opposition leader Karim Sanjabi was detained after returning to Iran after holding talks with Ayatollah Khomeini in Paris. Some are viewing the success in Khuzestan as a sign of a government comeback but that remains to be seen."
 Iranian_Revolution.24.d:0 "The Iranian military faces major strains in its efforts at controlling street protests and security. Many of the conscript soldiers lack proper crowd control training, leading to incidents of troops firing into crowds. In other instances, the conscripts are sympathetic to the protestors and end up refusing to break up the protests. Officers on the ground grow increasingly frustrated by the contradictory orders they receive from superiors. However, in recent weeks these strains have led to incidents of soldiers firing on officers who order them to fire at protestors. In some cases soldiers are publicly deserting and joining the protestors. Overall, the military informed the Shah that almost a thousand Iranian soldiers are deserting from their units each day. Many generals are unsure if they have enough men to carry out orders or even rely on them as the unrest continues."
 Iranian_Revolution.25.d:0 "The holy month of Muharram begins today. This month is especially the first ten days are important for the Shia as they mourn the martyrdom of Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. The tenth day, called Ashura, commemorates the actual event and is a time of mass public grief. The revolutionaries and protestors of the Shah have already planned a series of escalating protests that will culminate in a national Ashura march across Iran. Both the secular and religious opposition are working closely on these protests. The Iranian government cannot risk massive clashes during such an auspicious time, as such moves could cause an uprising within the military ranks."
 Iranian_Revolution.26.d:0 "In the leadup to the Ashura March, the Shah and protestors negotiated to prevent violent clashes. The Shah, desperate to avoid violence during Ashura, released political prisoners, including Karim Sanjabi. In addition, the ban on protests was lifted for Ashura and permits given to organizers. The protestors in return pledged to avoid violence. The Ashura March became a massive show of force, with some estimates suggesting at least ten million protests, over ten percent of all Iranians participating. It is being called the largest march in world history. Karim Sanjabi and Ayatollah Taleghani led the protests to symbolize the revolutionary unity of secular and religious opposition to the Shah. The Shah was said to be despondent by the reports."
 Iranian_Revolution.27.d:0 "The situation in Iran has reached a critical place. The Shah informed the ambassador that he does not know what can be done and his position looks untenable. This lack of decisiveness is clearly a major cause to the crisis and exacerbates anti-American sentiments among the Iranians. Some senior officials argue that if the Shah cannot survive, we must try to make a positive impression on the next regime. These officials propose we arrange a plan that would see the Shah abdicate and hand power to a republican government led by pro-Western officials and military officers. Others in the administration state the Iranian revolutionaries are already vehemently anti-American, any further involvement will only act as ammunition for our enemies in the region. The Shah will likely agree to what we have proposed but the President must decide whether to propose the plan to the opposition or hold off."
 Iranian_Revolution.28.d:0 "The Iranian opposition has held meetings with American officials over a political solution to the crisis. The Americans suggest a democratic setup could be established with Ayatollah Khomeini acting as a spiritual guide to the Iranian state. Khomeini and the Americans both felt the talks were positive, but a final agreement remained elusive at the moment. The Iranian opposition must decide whether it can achieve the removal of the Shah with the mediation of the Americans or if it can achieve it on its own. Using the Americans will likely result in a government with a strong presence of pro-American officials and a reduced role of the Shia clergy. However, if the opposition can remove the Shah themselves than they would have complete control over their destiny."
 Iranian_Revolution.29.d:0 "The Ashura March, army desertions, and economic collapse has made the situation untenable for the Shah. Observers note that the Ashura March saw at least ten percent of all Iranians participate, which is far higher than the three or four percent of French citizens who participated in the French Revolution. Needing an exit strategy, the Shah made an agreement with National Front leader Shahpour Bakhtiar to become Prime Minister. He also announced plans to take a vacation with his family and leave the country in the hands of a regency council headed by the Prime Minister. Bakhtiar joined the government out of his fear that Khomeini would not accept democracy for the country. However, his decision is being met with universal scorn among the secular and religious opposition. The National Front has expelled him, and Khomeini accused him of being obedient to false Gods."
 Iranian_Revolution.30.d:0 "Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his family flew out of Tehran, marking the end of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran. The Imperial Guard wept as the royal family boarded their plane while his Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar, a lifelong opponent of the Shah, could not hide his disdain for the monarch. He believed the Shah should stay to face the justice of the people. News quickly spread the Shah had left. Iranians took to the streets in joy and destroyed any symbols of the monarchy, from statues to portraits of the royal family. The Prime Minister directed the military to stand down and allow the people to express themselves as he sought to establish himself as the new leader."
 Iranian_Revolution.31.d:0 "Prime Minister Bakhtiar formally invited the Ayatollah Khomeini to return after his years of exile. The Ayatollah arrived soon after in a chartered flight to Tehran. Millions of Iranians took to the street to welcome the iconic revolutionary leader. His car was so badly mobbed that Khomeini eventually was taken out of the airport via helicopter. With crowds chanting his name and calling for him to lead the country, Khomeini remained stoic and firm. Despite the overture from the Prime Minister in inviting him, Khomeini criticized his government for being a product of the corrupt Shah. He also appeared to criticize the notion of a democracy without the leadership of clerics as an unacceptable scenario. He will likely take a more definitive stance in the next few days."
 Iranian_Revolution.32.d:0 "Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar, long-term opponent of the Shah took the post of Prime Minister on the condition the Shah leaves the country. However, his decision was met with condemnation from his former allies in the National Front and Ayatollah Khomeini. Both accused him of supporting and legitimizing the Shah. Since the Shah left the country, the Prime Minister claimed his was an interim government and he promised new elections under a democratic constitution. In addition, he disbanded the SAVAK secret police and released all political prisoners. He also ordered the military to no longer interfere in protests or demonstrations. These decisions and outreaches have opened talks with the National Front, but Ayatollah Khomeini continues to criticize Bakhtiar. Khomeini is left with a decision to make, he can either work with Bakhtiar and accept a limited role for the clergy in the new constitution, or he can order his supporters to establish a parallel interim government."
 Iranian_Revolution.33.d:0 "Over the past few days, Ayatollah Khomeini has directed his supporters to establish local government councils and setup a parallel government from the one of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar. Tens of thousands of young revolutionaries view Khomeini as their leader and eagerly carried out the order. Within days, the parallel government not only began administrating but also drove off loyalists of the Bakhtiar regime. For many Iranians, the only government they see functioning is the one directed by Khomeini. Revolutionary youths have also raided arms depots and captured heavy weapons, the local military forces declined to intervene, fearing civilian casualties. Despite his efforts, Bakhtiar appears unable to bridge the gap between his base and the revolutionary youths who are spearheading the revolution. With his position deteriorating, the Supreme Military Council is considering if it can continue to support the Prime Minister."
 Iranian_Revolution.34.d:0 "The Supreme Military Council announced it will be neutral in the ongoing struggle between the government of Prime Minister Bakhtiar and Ayatollah Khomeini. Without the backing of the military, Bakhtiar saw his last group of supporters flee as revolutionary youths seized government buildings, palaces, radio and television stations. Bakhtiar himself is said to have fled the country as he escaped armed revolutionaries. This defeat marks the final collapse of the last remnant of the old regime. With Khomeini and his supporters rapidly gaining power, the secular opposition, led by the National Front, is finalizing a new constitution for the country, which they say provides a role for the clergy. It remains to be seen if Khomeini and his supporters will allow a new constitution that does not offer a complete Islamic Republic."
 Iranian_Revolution.35.d:0 "Since the final collapse of the old regime, Ayatollah Khomeini has governed through his Revolutionary Council and subsidiary organizations. The secular opposition led by the National Front and ostensibly allied with Khomeini is organized as the National Democratic Front. The Muslim Peoples Republican Party consists of moderate clergy led by Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari. They argue for a more moderate Islamic Republic than proposed by Khomeini. All these political forces were once united in opposition to the Shah but now they are all engaged in competition with one another over the future of Iran."
 Iranian_Revolution.36.d:0 "The Revolutionary Council held a national referendum in which the people of Iran were asked to either approve of an Islamic Republic or not. Critics, like the National Democratic Front find the referendum too vague as there is no clear indication what an Islamic Republic really is. The referendum was also boycotted by the Kurdish population who remain vehemently opposed to the installation of a Shia theocracy over their largely Sunni population. In the end result, ninety eight percent voted to approve an Islamic Revolution. Ayatollah Khomeini lauded the result claiming it represented an overwhelming confirmation for his efforts to establish a true Islamic Republic."
 Iranian_Revolution.37.d:0 "The Iranian Revolution has caused a backlash with royalist, Marxist, and ethnic organizations rising in revolt against revolutionary forces. Khuzestan and Iranian Kurdistan are major hotbeds for this violence. In Khuzestan, some Arab residents are demanding greater autonomy, leading to armed clashes with security forces. For the Kurds, the revolution and the emphasis on an Islamic Republic led by Shias is opposed by this largely Sunni ethnic group. The Kurdish uprising is being led by leftist fighters bent on achieving either autonomy or independence. In other areas, small bands of Marxists are targeting revolutionary leaders leading to even more clashes. However, the revolutionary forces, backed by the immense resources of the former military of the Shah appear more than capable of handling these threats."
 Iranian_Revolution.38.d:0 "The Revolutionary Council recognizes the rise of different groups of opponents across the country and they are especially concerned with the remnants of the old military of the Shah. These soldiers remain in their barracks and their officers can activate them whenever they choose. To counter this influence, they have agreed to establish a Revolutionary Guard, consisting of armed, organized activists who will protect the revolution from usurpers or enemies. The new force is already launching operations to disrupt the political rallies and organization of rival political parties. In the following weeks the Revolutionary Guard is expected to be a viable counter to the threat still posed by the old military."
 Iranian_Revolution.39.d:0 "With the successful removal of the Shah, many have asked Ayatollah Khomeini his opinion on Islamic Revolution in the wider Islamic world. Prior to his return, Khomeini had suggested all Muslim states were in need of such transformation but now that he is in a senior position and in command, he must decide on whether to endorse the export of the Revolution or not. Exporting the revolution generally fits the ideology Khomeini espouses and him publicly speaking on this will strengthen his base of support, especially in neighboring Iraq. However, if he choses to instead claim the revolution should focus on the internal, he risks alienating his most devoted followers, but such a statement would calm his neighbors."
 Iranian_Revolution.40.d:0 "Prior to the final collapse of the monarchy, Hassan Habibi proposed a constitution for Iran. In his version, Iran will have a strong President and a legislature. A council of clerics will advise on laws but could not draft or reject legislation. Leftists accused it of being too much like the old constitution with a President instead of a Shah. As a result an Assembly of Experts, consisting mostly of clerics is reviewing the document to finalize its approval. There are two factions, one backed by Khomeini who are proposing radical changes to the document in order to establish a true Islamic Republic. The moderate clergy wants to keep the document as is but give the council of clerics more power to strike down legislature deemed offensive to Islam. The country awaits to see what constitution emerges."
 Iranian_Revolution.41.d:0 "With his power protected by the Revolutionary Guard and his Islamic Republic enshrined in the constitution, Ayatollah Khomeini stands triumphant over the other revolutionary groups. To ensure a smooth transfer of authority, he has directed the Revolutionary Guard and other networks to forcibly suppress the parties of secularists and moderate clerics. Khomeini believes the Iranian people need clear direction and one voice to guide them into this new era for the country. Khomeini has also appointed the clerics who will serve as key executive leaders and advisors to the new regime. Within days of his directive, most organized opposition to Khomeini either collapsed, fled into exile, or went into hiding."
 Iranian_Revolution.42.d:0 "With the establishment of the Islamic Republic and news of the Shah undergoing medical treatment in the United States, crowds of angry students have started a series of violent protests outside the American embassy. They are demanding the Shah return and accuse the American government of covertly trying to overthrow the new Islamic Republic. The Prime Minister has successfully prevented the situation from escalating out of control but security personnel inform him the situation is quickly escalating. The Prime Minister decided to request Ayatollah Khomeini to calm the students before their protests lead to disaster. Ayatollah Khomeini can either condone the students and maintain his influence over the revolutionary youth, or reign them in and risk losing such vital support as he builds a new Iran."
 Iranian_Revolution.43.d:0 "After intense mediation by American diplomats, the Shah of Iran agreed to abdicate his throne. After a moving ceremony where he and his family bid farewell to their staff at the palace, the Shah was taken to the airport where he signed the abdication papers, marking the end of the Pahlavi dynasty. A chartered American government plane than took him and his family to the United States. Within hours of the Shah leaving Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini arrived from Paris. The streets of Tehran and other major cities were filled with jubilant crowds celebrating the removal of the Shah and the return of Khomeini. It was only through American negotiations that the Shah was able to leave in as dignified a way as he could. Upon his arrival, Khomeini stated his support for the constitutional process."
 Iranian_Revolution.44.d:0 "A constitution has been written by secular politicians and democratic leaders. The document calls for a republic with a committee of clerics to advise on legislation. The clergy will not have the power to veto or propose legislation. Before it can finally be approved, an Assembly of Experts, consisting mostly of clergy must meet to decide if the constitution confirms with Islamic law. Within the clergy there is a divide, moderates believe the clergy should minimize interactions with the state while the more politically minded, inspired by Khomeini and Shariati believe in an Islamic government. The United States, due to its role as mediators, was able to use its influence to ensure the moderates dominated the Assembly of Experts."
 Iranian_Revolution.45.d:0 "The decision to mediate during the crisis came at a critical time. Although we lost our long-time ally the Shah, we did successfully arrange his safe departure and established links with the new regime. The Shah and his family will live comfortably and under our protection. More importantly, our role in helping the Iranian people achieve a republic and constitution has restored our prestige in the country. Although many Iranians still hold us responsible for past injustices, our actions have ensured the new government will at the very least be cordial. Overtime we hope to re-establish our intimate relationship with the Iranian government."
 Iranian_Revolution.46.d:0 "The cycle of chehelom protests has gone on for months now, hurting the economy and stability of Iran. However, the last two cycles of protests saw a steep rise in protests after an initial drop. The decision of the Shah to use military force and ruthlessly put down the protests did seem to suppress the unrest at first. However, the number of deaths, especially during funeral events ended up infuriating the religious minded and clergy. Even moderate clerics, traditionally loyal to the Shah, are working closely with the revolutionary clerics to bring the faithful out to protest. During the last chehelom protests, the largest crowds emerged across Iran. Although the military had ordered the firing of weapons as a last resort, inexperienced soldiers often panicked, leading to numerous deaths across the country. Now even secular opposition groups have promised to participate in larger numbers during the next chehelom protest in forty days."
 Iranian_Revolution.47.d:0 "As the next cycle of chehelom protests approaches, the situation within the Iranian military appears dire. Many soldiers are conscripts and the chehelom orders to disperse protestors and incidents of shootings are taking a toll. Desertions are increasing and senior officers are losing control over their subordinates. Some officers report that their soldiers have promised that if ordered to shoot protestors, they will instead shoot the officers. The military high command has largely dismissed these reports as exaggerated and are telling the Shah to remain firm as they believe the protests will soon run out of steam."
 Iranian_Revolution.48.d:0 "The next chehelom protests are not for several days but Tehran is full of military activity. Officers are cordoning off key area of the city. The Defense Ministry in particular is completely surrounded. The senior officers were meeting there with the Shah and his cabinet to discuss security arrangements for the next protest. When news reached those assembled, that the building was surrounded, two of the senior officers, known moderates, announced the situation had grown intolerable, and several armed soldiers entered the room. The Shah was then informed that officers and soldiers in the military were largely unwilling to continue the slaughter of citizens and called for him to remove all the generals and advisors who advocated the crackdown or risk the disintegration of Iran. The Shah is aware his own Imperial Guards would likely restore order soon so he can wait the moderates out, or he can join their action and order the senior officials and officers to be seized."
 Iranian_Revolution.49.d:0 "The Shah condoned the actions of the moderate officers and ordered his Imperial Guard to aid the soldiers in rounding up the hardline officers and officials. The Shah then addressed the nation, stating he had been grossly misled and patriotic members of the military were able to guide him on the right path. He announced the next chhelom protest would go on without interference from the military. During the protests, the crowds praised the military and continued to condemn the Shah. The moderate officers then privately informed the Shah his situation was no longer tenable. Within days the Shah, much like his father, announced his abdication to the throne for his son. A regency council headed by his wife and consisting of senior military officers will reach out to the opposition and discuss plans for a new constitution. The Shah himself plans to immediately leave the country for an extended period."
 Iranian_Revolution.50.d:0 "The Shah called the bluff of the moderate officers and within the hour his Imperial Guard had restored control of Tehran. There were no major incidents of violence as the coup plotters knew without the Shah the plan would collapse. The moderate generals and their subordinates were detained and will likely face a court martial. The Shah and his senior officials see this coup as a conspiracy from the protestors and plan on redoubling their efforts. The Shah has already approved plans for martial law to be implemented in several strategic areas where the loyalty of officers is not certain. An emboldened Shah has also approved more measures to punish protestors and detain suspected opposition leaders." 
 Iranian_Revolution.51.d:0 "With the Assembly of Experts largely approving the constitution presented to it, all eyes are on Ayatollah Khomeini. From the earliest days of the revolution, Khomeini had advocated not just the removal of the Shah but a true Islamic Republic. Many of his supporters view the new constitution as not giving the clergy enough power or influence. With these supporters becoming increasingly vocal and at times hostile, the senior Iranian clergy has demanded Khomeini publicly endorse the new constitution and be the chairman of the clergy council to advise the Majles. If Khomeini accepts, his base will lose momentum but he will gain a senior position in the new government, however, if he refuses he can galvanize his supporters to his position."
 Iranian_Revolution.52.d:0 "Having defied the senior clergy and new government, Ayatollah Khomeini has directed his supporters and Revolutionary Guard to establish parallel governments across the provinces and cities. They will provide direction and administration while Khomeini and his Revolutionary Council direct from Tehran. The order is being carried out enthusiastically, especially among the youth and the new government is finding itself being forcibly pushed out across the country. The remnants of the royal military have approached the government and announced its willingness to help it restore order and implement the new constitution."
 Iranian_Revolution.53.d:0 "The Iranian government emboldened by confirmation that the former military forces will help it in a power struggle against Ayatollah Khomeini issued an ultimatum. The reconfirmed their offer to give Khomeini the chairmanship of the council of clerics if he agrees to stand down by disbanding his parallel government. In addition, he must direct the Revolutionary Guard to disarm. Backing the ultimatum is the signature of several senior generals who promise to ensure the supremacy of the constitution. Already military units are said to be mobilizing in barracks across the country. Khomeini can accept the terms, or he can defy the ultimatum. He has many within his camp who argue the military will be incapable of acting against him."
 Iranian_Revolution.54.d:0 "With the ultimatum ignored by Khomeini, the Iranian military moved in to disarm and shutdown his parallel government. Intense fighting quickly emerged between the Revolutionary Guard and the military. More concerning for the government was the defection of several units, including heavy equipment to Khomeini. The military appeared to have over-estimated its own abilities and it is clear Iran is facing a full-fledged Civil War. The winner of this conflict will determine the future of the country, either as a Republic or an Islamic Republic."
 Iranian_Revolution.55.d:0 "The Supreme Military Council and the Shah both recognize the period of unrest had recently been under control due to talks and concessions with the opposition, especially the moderate clergy. Following the recent spike in unrest, it was decided to try and use those connections to restore order. In addition, the military was instructed to avoid clashing with protestors and local government officials were encouraged to also give the protestors permits, all in order to avoid bloodshed. After several weeks of intense discussions, the Shah agreed to appoint several clergy as senior government advisors and sign an agreement guaranteeing the rights of Iranian citizens as enshrined in the constitution. These two reforms give the religious opposition a seat at the table and guarantees the secular opposition protection from unlawful detentions or crackdowns. There are still protests but the numbers are beginning to drop."
 Iranian_Revolution.56.d:0 "In a highly publicized event, senior cabinet and leaders from the Supreme Military Council pledged undying loyalty to the heir of the throne and his mother, who the Shah designated to be regent. The Shah stated the event was meant to assure the country the continuation of the Pahlavi dynasty and stability of the government. For observers, the event is seen as confirmation that the Shah may be suffering from health issues as his public appearances have noticeably declined recently. Even during the event, despite being in his finest uniform, the Shah appeared off and sickly to those attending."
 Iranian_Revolution.57.d:0 "The Shah of Iran left for the United States for what he termed to be routine medical procedures. The Shah announced he would not leave the country without firm leadership and appointed a Regency Council to govern in his absence. The Regency Council will be under the control of his wife, the Queen. Members of the Supreme Military Council were also appointed. Considering his family remains behind, many expect the Shah to return soon but his decision to leave continues to fuel speculation over his health."
 Iranian_Revolution.58.d:0 "The concessions offered by the government and the appointment of senior clergy to senior advisory positions have largely ended the protests against the government. Those still participating are largely the most radical anti-monarchists and devoted followers of Ayatollah Khomeini. The military recently informed the Regency Council that they no longer believed the protests posed a threat to the government or even public order. This marks a major victory for the government and bodes well for the Regency Council as it awaits the return of the Shah from his medical treatments in the United States."
 Iranian_Revolution.59.d:0 "Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi passed away yesterday in the United States. He had been undergoing medical treatment, now understood to be cancer treatment. His body was quickly flown back to Tehran where his family, including his young son, received it at the airport. The Imperial Guard shutdown most of the main roads as the body was taken to the palace as funeral preparations are underway. Many foreign dignitaries are already arriving in the country to attend his funeral. The reaction of the public is largely muted, the Shah had a complicated history with his people. He oversaw massive reform and modernization efforts but also maintained a firm hold of power with accusations that his government committed human rights violations to maintain power. The new Shah, Reza Pahlavi is expected to eventually be enthroned by his mother and the Regency Council."
 Iranian_Revolution.60.d:0 "Following the death of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Supreme Military Council publicly announced confirmation that it continues to support the Regency Council of Queen Farah. It added that the powers of the Shah will also be preserved through the council and when his son is ready, Shah Reza Pahlavi will take the throne with the full powers of his father. The announcement is seen as a clear threat to anyone within the country who may have been plotting to undermine or challenge the monarchy during this period of transition. Overall it appears the population of Iran is willing to see what type of leader Shah Reza is and the announcement was mostly meant for ambitious government officials or military leaders."
 Iranian_Revolution.61.d:0 "After spirited debates and discussions, the Assembly of Experts approved the constitution with only slight modifications. The council of clergy will have more say in legislation related to social issues, however, the overall structure of a legislature and strong executive branch were approved. Leftists are disappointed as they fear the President may simply become a new Shah under the new system, but many across the country praise the transformation of Iran into a republic. Although the clerics are largely happy, it remains to be seen how the Ayatollah Khomeini and his supporters will feel about a republic in which the clerics do not govern."
 Iranian_Revolution.62.d:0 "After discussions between the Regency Council and the opposition, including the National Front and anti-government clergy, a new constitution has been approved. The new constitution empowers the Prime Minister to govern through the Majles. The Shah will be left with largely ceremonial functions and a role within the military. The Regency Council accepted these terms as the Shah is currently too young and the public atmosphere is quite opposed to the monarchy. Although the Iranian public is said to largely approve the document and look forward to new elections, some observers fear the clause giving the Shah an unspecified role in the military could prove to be a way for the monarchy to eventually return."

 Iranian_Iraq_War.1.d:0 "Several government buildings in predominantly Shia neighborhoods were bombed recently. The identities of the bombers are unknown, but reports indicate it was likely Shia radicals inspired by the Iranian Revolution. The Ayatollah Khomeini has continuously called on Iraqi Shias to join the revolution and overthrow our government. He continues to make these statements despite efforts from our diplomats begging him to stop. Such actions make our government look week and embolden the radicals. An investigation is being immediately opened."
 Iranian_Iraq_War.2.d:0 "Despite our continued pleas for Ayatollah Khomeini to stop calling for Iraqi Shias to rise against the government, he continues to do so. This dangerous rhetoric continues to cause problems as several government officials have recently been assassinated. Once again it is clear the perpetrators are radicals inspired by Khomeini. These attacks, along with the bombings are clear provocations. A senior meeting of government officials is being called together to consider our options on dealing with the Iranian threat."
 Iranian_Iraq_War.3.d:0 "During a meeting of senior government and military officers, discussions were held on how to deal with the continued radicalization of our Shia youth by Ayatollah Khomeini. One faction argues the Iranian Revolution threatens not just our people but also our Arab brothers in Khuzestan. For them, the best approach would be to liberate Khuzestan and its oil fields. With that under our control we can dictate to Khomeini what he can or cannot say. Such an operation would likely be easy to achieve as the Iranian military is in disarray after the revolution. The other faction argues we should continue diplomatic efforts and let the situation simmer down. Though the bombings and assassinations are discouraging, it appears to be the work of a small minority that we can eventually root out."
 Iranian_Iraq_War.4.d:0 "Iraqi troops backed by tanks and airpower crossed the Iranian border for Khuzestan. The Iraqi government announced the operation is a response to Iranian terrorism against the Iraqi people. It also added the Iranian government posed an existential threat to the Arabs of Khuzestan and Iraq is doing its duty to liberate them. Initial Iranian resistance appears to be almost non-existent so far. However, there are already reports that the former military assets of the Shah are being mobilized along with enthusiastic volunteers to counter the Iraqi invasion."
 Iranian_Iraq_War.5.d:0 "Our government is watching the situation in Iran very closely. The successful revolution will have many consequences for us. Our own sizable Shia population may fall under the influence of radical ideologies and this must be controlled. At the same time the chaos in Iran may present us some opportunities. We border the Iranian Kurdish territory and the oil-rich Arab populated province of Khuzestan. If the government and military situation deteriorates dramatically, this may present an opportunity for our forces to act. For years the size and strength of Iran deterred and limited our options, but amidst the revolutionary unrest, we may find solutions to decades old disputes."
 Iranian_Iraq_War.6.d:0 "News of the Iranian Revolution successfully removing the Shah indicate a new shift in the region and in our relationship with Iran. Our government and the Shah signed several treaties in recent years over our shared border. With him no longer in power and the Iranian military no doubt in turmoil, this may be the moment for us to resolve the disputes in our favor. We can certainly argue the treaties no longer apply now and it is in the best interest of the world that we secure those lands and the people living there to protect them from the revolutionary violence. Others in the cabinet argue against an intervention, they believe we should wait to see what government emerges and engage them. By publicly declaring our respect for the treaties we could perhaps pivot into a close relationship with Iran."

 Biafra_War.1.d:0 "Nigeria is home to a multitude of cultural, ethnic, and religious groupings. Geographically, the north, southwest, and southeast were dominated by the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo ethnic groups respectively. Independence led to continued conflict and tension as each group tried to gain influence over the central government. A frustrated cabal of Igbo officers attempted a bloody coup targeting northern officers and politicians who were accused of exploiting the resources in southeastern Nigeria and corruption. Though the coup was defeated, its aftermath led to a nationwide pogrom against the Igbo. Nearly two million Igbo living in the north or southwest fled back to the southeast. With the military and government supporting the violence, the besieged Igbo, led by Colonel Odemegwu Ojukwu declared the formation the Republic of Biafra. The Nigerian government condemned the announcement and is preparing to send military forces to quell the uprising. Ojukwu announced all the people of Biafra, regardless of identity, would be ready to face any invasion."
 Biafra_War.2.d:0 "\nThe Biafran government announced the establishment of the Republic of Benin in the Mid-Western Region of Nigeria where its forces occupy the territory. The news is said to be an effort by the Biafran government to ensure the loyalty and support of the people living there. At the start of the war the Mid-Western Region sought to facilitate peace and refused entry to federal troops, but following the Biafran occupation and increasing violence, the population was said to be increasingly opposed to the Biafran presence. They see the conflict as one between the Igbo and the Nigerian state. However, with this new announcement, the Biafran government hopes the locals will now actively join for their own state. The Republic of Benin is being led by the medical doctor Albert Okonkwo, but critics note the Republic of Benin is effectively a puppet state for Biafra."
 Biafra_War.3.d:0 "Despite a valiant resistance, the Republic of Biafra finally collapsed during the latest offensive by the Nigerian military. The combination of an economic blockade and aggressive military operations were able to finally overcome Biafran resistance. The blockade extended internationally as the Nigerian government successfully kept Biafra from establishing diplomatic relations with outside states. The Nigerian operations were widely criticized for their impact on civilian populations, but the Nigerian government insists it was the refusal of the Biafran resistance to end its violent struggle that forced its hand. Many Nigerian leaders are already calling for a National Reconciliation policy to the former Biafran residents, however, there are already reports of sporadic incidence of anti-Igbo violence."
 Biafra_War.4.d:0 "The Nigerian government formally recognized the independence of the Republic of Biafra, ending the Nigerian civil war. This follows a series of military setbacks, including the loss of the Mid-Western Region. As part of the agreement, Nigeria also agreed to recognize the Biafran established Republic of Benin which governs the Mid-Western Region. The Republic of Biafra announced its victory was for all the oppressed peoples of the world and vindication to the Igbo victims of the anti-Igbo pogroms which caused the conflict initially. The Nigerian government gave up its efforts at unifying the country following its military defeats and fears within the leadership that continued Biafran success could lead to a further disintegration of the diverse nation. Now that the conflict has ended, the Biafra government will have to rebuild and keep its own minority populations satisfied as it faces accusations of being partisan to the Igbo majority which started the civil war."

 Rajk.1.d:0 "Laszlo Rajk was arrested by the government on charges of collaborating with capitalists, being a Titoist, and betraying Hungarian independence. This marks the end of an early leaders of the Hungarian Communist Party. He fought in the Spanish Civil War and during World War II was arrested for his actions against the Fascist regime. A popular leader, he has served as Interior Minister and Foreign Minister, helping purge Hungary of counterrevolutionaries and establishing the state security agency, the AVH. However, Hungarian Premier Matyas Rakosi has begun to view the popular leader as a threat to him. The Soviets also feel his statements as Foreign Minister undermined diplomatic efforts, especially with regards to Yugoslavia. With Soviet aid, Rakosi acted against Rajk and many are seeing his arrest as Rakosi beginning to consolidate his hold over Hungary and the party."
 Kadar.1.d:0 "Janos Kadar, a once rising communist leader and political coordinator, was arrested by the AVH under the orders of Premier Matyas Rakosi. Kadar is being accused of being a spy for the previous fascist regime of Miklos Horthy. Many view the charges as trumped up and represent a powerplay by Rakosi to consolidate power over the government. Kadar recently resigned as Interior Minister citing health issues, many suspecting he was trying to avoid arrest, but this did not protect him. He is currently undergoing interrogation by the AVH and will soon be brought to trial to face his charges. The party has already stripped him of his status."
 Golden_Team.1:0 "The Hungarian national football team has emerged to be the most dominant teams in recent times, called the Golden Team. The team is led by manager Gusztav Sebes, a former trade union organizer. The leading players are Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis, Nandor Hidegkuti, Zoltan Czibor, Jozsef Bozsik, and Gyula Grosics. Sebes has implemented a scientific fitness program, tactical flexibility, and a demand of versatility of all his players. This allows the team to play a much more dynamic game that excites crowds and wins matches. The team has dominated some of the traditional football powerhouses, including a stunning victory over England on their home soil. Their victories are being lauded by the government as an example of the superiority of the socialist man. Among the Hungarians these victories are encouraging national pride, which some communist hardliners are slightly concerned with."
 Nagy.1.d:0 "Politburo member and former Speaker of the National Assembly Imre Nagy was recently appointed Prime Minister of Hungary. A World War I veteran, he fought for the Reds during the Russian Revolution and eventually settled for a time in Moscow. He returned to Hungary after World War II and is seen as a reliable partner for Matyas Rakosi. He helped sign several arrest orders during the recent purge, showing his loyalty to Rakosi. Moscow will also be pleased with the appointment of a man who was a major informant for the NKVD during his time in Moscow. However, there are some rumors regarding the nationalistic tendencies of Nagy, though this did appear to deter his appointment."
 SOV_HUN.1.d:0 "The Hungarian government has asked for approval over their recent reforms as part of a New Course in socialism campaign by Prime Minister Imre Nagy. Since his appointment, Nagy has initiated a series of moves meant to reduce the coercive powers of the government. He calls this a New Course and this has entailed the release of political prisoners and legal reforms. These actions have garnered Nagy popularity among the people but is facing opposition within the party. Many Hungarian communists believe these coercive powers and actions are what sustain the state and are essential for the socialist transformation of Hungary. They fear the reforms of Nagy weaken the state, are doctrinally opposed to the Soviet model, and could foster unrest. These are certainly important considerations, but it should be noted that the reforms have improved relations between the people and state, which may prove vital in the coming years."
 SOV_HUN.2.d:0 "The Soviet government responded positively to our request for approval over the recent reforms. This embrace by Moscow of the New Course socialism of Prime Minister Imre Nagy will silence the hardliners within the party and allow us to expand the liberalization campaign. Prime Minister Nagy in response noted this approval will allow the government to more openly and effectively initiate the policies desired by the Hungarian people and help them assert their will through a government dedicated to the people. With Soviet blessing it makes it very difficult for the opposition within the Hungarian Communist Party to openly challenge Nagy."
 SOV_HUN.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union strongly condemned the reforms initiated by Prime Minister Imre Nagy. They stated the reforms go against doctrine, cater to counterrevolutionaries, and will allow outside powers to undermine the Hungarian state. The strong Soviet opposition to the reforms was a major blow to the Prime Minister. Opposition within the Hungarian Communist Party was then able to rally those who were neutral and it now appears that the government of Imre Nagy will end. Due to the strong condemnation from Moscow, when Nagy is removed from office he will likely be stripped of his senior positions within the Hungarian party. Although this is a victory for the hardliners, many Hungarians will be disappointed at the removal of the popular leader."
 Kadar.5.d:0 "Prime Minister Imre Nagy, as part of his drive to reform some of the more coercive elements of the Hungarian state released several prominent political prisoners, including Janos Kadar. Kadar had been a rising star in the party before being purged and convicted in a show trial for his alleged opposition to Stalin and Matyas Rakosi. Since being released from prison and rehabilitated Kadar accepted a post as a party secretary for an industrial sector of Budapest. Already he is showing his skill as a political operator by recruiting workers and building a strong following among them. Many in the country expect Kadar will soon return to the prominence he had before being arrested."
 Rakosi.1.d:0 "Former Hungarian strongman and ardent Stalinist Matyas Rakosi has been ruled out for any leadership position. His oppressive state apparatus, purges, and cult of personality have long alienated him from not just the Hungarian people but also leading communists in his own party and the Soviet Union. He is viewed as a relic from a previous time that the socialist states are attempting to evolve and learn from. During the Hungarian Revolution his own supporters and successors proved largely ineffective and out of touch, confirming that Rakosi has no place in the future of Hungary."
 Hungarian_Collectivized.1.d:0 "Although the initial attempts at agricultural collectivization in Hungary ended in failure, the most recent effort proved to be a great success. The Hungarian government announced that well over ninety percent of agricultural land was the property of collective farms. The government claims it success was due to reforms and a commitment to a proper socialist approach to the issue. Analysts notes the latest effort was much more gradualist and did not rely on coercion to force collectivization. The state of oppression in the earlier efforts also stifled innovation and open discussions which also hindered those attempts. The government congratulated the state agencies and peasants for achieving collectivization and promised future agricultural growth and prosperity."

 #News Event 
 Hungary_Anti_Semetic.1.d:0 "Anti-Semitism and Anti-Zionism are rising among Hungarians. On the surface this appears strange considering the communist regime has long linked traditional anti-Semitic tropes with the fascist regime of Miklos Horthy. The Soviet Union long argued that all peoples were victims of fascism in the last war, those who emphasize the suffering of the Jews during the Holocaust are seen as nationalists acting against socialist unity. Hungary has followed this lead and have cracked down on reports regarding the Holocaust in the country and any activists for the rehabilitation of Jewish victims are also being targeted. Zionism is accused of encouraging nationalism and division as well, and those supporters are also being suppressed by the Hungarian government."
 Wallenberg.1.d:0 "A series of trials were held over the mysterious disappearance and presumed death of Raoul Wallenberg. Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat and architect who played a major role in arranging the rescue of thousands of Hungarian Jews by providing them safe havens and protective passports. Following the liberation of Budapest by Soviet forces, Wallenberg disappeared, and many suggest he died in Soviet custody. However, the Hungarian government started the trials to prove Wallenberg had not been murdered by the Soviets. Instead, the trials argued it was a group of Budapest Jews and former members of the fascist regime who carried out the murder of Wallenberg. All the suspects were convicted during the trials, although many international observers decried them as victims of show trials. Many note the trials were a convenient way for the communist regime to downplay any Soviet involvement and instead blame fascists and the Hungarian Jewish community, both groups currently being targeted by the state."
 Kadar.2.d:0 "Senior communist leader Janos Kadar has been appointed General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party. Kadar throughout his career has shown a skill in converting supporters for the party and organizing workers. This ability makes him an influential figure. With Matyas Rakosi and his clique discredited, Kadar is an ideal leader for the Hungarian people and the Soviet government. Although he publicly appears quite loyal to the Hungarian Party, he has fostered good ties with the Soviets. More importantly he is a believer in the Soviet order and they trust him to work on ensuring Hungary stays a loyal partner in the global socialist order."
 Nagy_Executed.1.d:0 "In a surprise announcement, the Hungarian government announced former Prime Minister Imre Nagy was executed after being convicted by a Hungarian court. It had kept the trial and sentence secret from the public, only announcing it after the sentence was carried out. The government feared public and international outcry. Nagy was convicted of treason and attempting to overthrow the Hungarian state. The government has refused to allow any access to the grave and no public outcry has occurred. This is due to the deployment of security personnel and the zero-tolerance policy of the current government. As Prime Minister, Imre Nagy sought to liberalize society, return Democracy, and achieve Hungarian neutrality, but his efforts failed after the Soviet Union invaded to restore the communist regime. The declaration of the execution is seen across the Soviet sphere as a warning to leaders what awaits them if they do not obey Moscow."


 cam.1.d:0 "King Norodom Sihanouk has decided to dissolve the National Assembly led by Prime Minister Yem Samaur. Months earlier, Prime Minister Penn Nouth had been facing increasing attacks from the opposition over the rise in corruption and economic problems across Cambodia. He had been replaced by Yem Samaur, a former member of the Democratic Party and a man with close ties to the royal family and traditional elites. The Democratic Party then put pressure on the King to dissolve the assembly. Fearing the Democratic Party might seek to mobilize its street supporters, the King has agreed. With the National Assembly dissolved, Cambodia will be run by royal decree until new elections are held. Many in the country hope a new National Assembly will better reflect the people and ensure more stable governance in the future."
 CAM_Recognition.2.d:0 "King Norodom Sihanouk has increasingly recognized continued French control over Cambodian ministries and policies has led to widespread anti-French sentiment in the country. This in turn has led to criticism of the monarchy and the government for being complicit with the French presence in Cambodia. The King recently travelled to France and asked for complete independence. The French government refused and in response the King conducted an international tour of the United States and Canada. He argued for Cambodian independence as the best means of combating communist influence in the region to a receptive audience. Upon returning to Cambodia, the King organized massive public rallies for independence and blessed the formation of a new militia to fight for independence. He had also refused to return to the capital, however the French have recently returned several ministries to the government and have agreed to discuss Cambodian independence in the near future."
 CAM_Exile.1.d:0 "Following the dramatic coup led by Lon Nol and anti-Vietnamese riots in Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk has decided to remain abroad and not return to the country. The former King, in a radio broadcast, accused the new government of stealing power and urged Cambodians to rise up against the new regime. Prince Sihanouk is expected to stay with friendly governments close to Cambodia and organize international support for the return of his government. He is also organizing a government-in-exile and will likely also try to organize armed fighters to restore his rule. Although his initial broadcast did lead to protests in the capital, at the moment, the new government appears to be firmly in power, but Sihanouk appears determined to bring together forces to end the new government and restore his rule."
 CAM_Exile.2.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk returned to Cambodia today to resume the ceremonial responsibilities as the Head of State. The new ruling government in Cambodia recently offered him the position and called on the former King to return from his exile. Prince Sihanouk thanked the new government and the people of Cambodia for working together with him to end the previous regime of Lon Nol. Most Cambodians, regardless of political views, view the monarchy as a vital institution of stability and order for the country. They largely welcome the return of the former monarch, though there are many who believe he should limit himself to his ceremonial position and not seek to engage in politics as he has in the past. Many would like to see a ceremonial monarchy formally restored soon with Sihanouk restored as King."
 Rep_Cam.1.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk was informed that Governor Chhuon was plotting on organizing a coup against the government. The details were murky, and the Prince decided to wait to uncover more information. This ended up being a mistake as the plotters discovered the Prince new and immediately acted. The Khmer Serai fighters staged an uprising in the northeast. The Prince sent troops to quell it, but they proved ineffective. This increased the tension and unease in the capital. When the Prince tried to order more troops to move in, the military turned on the Prince for his failure to keep order. After the military secured key government institutions and politicians, they announced a new government, consisting of many anti-communists, will take over. The new government then proclaimed Cambodia will now be known as the Republic of Cambodia and its people will no longer be pawns of communist foreigners or an aloof monarch."
 Assasination_Nop.1.d:0 "Nop Bophann was a leading newspaper editor and a representative of the United Issarak Front was brutally gunned down in the capital, near the main military barracks. The United Issarak Front was an anti-colonial, leftist Cambodian resistance group which had waged war against the French colonial authorities. The assassination has angered many leftist and communist supporters across the country. It puts tremendous pressure on the Cambodian government who have been trying to maintain balance with communist and anti-communist factions operating in the country. Many fear the assassination had been ordered by anti-communist military officers who are seeking to destabilize the situation and force the government to act against communists by provoking a leftist response. However, supporters of the anti-communist factions note this could have been a communist plot to frame them and force the government to crackdown on their supporters. The assassination has raised instability and tensions across the country."
 VIN_CAM.1.d:0 "Senior representatives of the Republic of Vietnam and Cambodia recently signed a Mutual Defense Treaty. The agreement commits both neighbors to protect and aid one another from outside threats. Many view the treaty as a direct challenge to communist North Vietnam which has been accused of fomenting unrest and deploying troops in those states. Indeed, a spokesman for North Vietnam noted the agreement was one of two puppet regimes desperately trying to ensure their illegal regimes remain in power despite the wishes and desires of the people. However, both Cambodia and South Vietnam insist they are not disturbed by this reaction and this treaty reflects the shared interests and historical ties that bind both nations."
 Bangkok_Coup.5.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk was informed that Governor Chhuon was a main conspirator in the plot against his government. Prince Sihanouk decided to act immediately and deployed a battalion of troops to arrest Chhuon. Chhuon was eventually captured by troops who also detained an American citizen working with Chhuon. Under military interrogation, Chhuon began confessing but died quickly. He had not revealed all the co-conspirators and the Prince suspects Chhuon did not survive the interrogation because military leaders did not want to be implicated. The Prince knows the Khmer Serai was meant to be the military force to implement the plot and were working with anti-communist politicians. They and the Khmer Serai will be closely watched from now on. Relations with Thailand will be downgraded as they support the Khmer Serai and Sihanouk lodged a protest with the United States over their citizen being caught collaborating with Chhuon."
 
 Bangkok_Coup.1.d:0 "Since the end of World War II, the Cambodian government, led by former King, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has struggled to balance its relationship with communists, anti-communists, and traditional elites. This has frustrated many and those on the right, working closely with intelligence agents from Thailand and some say even the United States, are planning action to remove Prince Sihanouk. They want to replace the Prince and establish a firmly anti-communist regime to protect Cambodia from communist encroachment, especially from its neighbors. Former royal advisor Sam Sary, working with powerful nationalist militia commander Son Ngc Thanh and Governor Dap Chhuon are planning on using the militia, the Khmer Serai, to instigate a revolt in the northeast. From the chaos they would then seize power with the help of allies in the capital. Sary and Thanh are ready for action and are putting the plot into action..."
 Bangkok_Coup.2.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk was informed that militant fighters were raised in revolt in the northeast. He was not aware that this force as actually Khmer Serai fighters aiding the coup attempt by sowing unrest. The Prince initially thought of sending an immediate force to quell the unrest but instead he first chose to address the nation. He called on citizens to unite against the threat to Cambodia and supplemented the military force with local militia fighters. This proved decisive as they discovered the Khmer Serai fighters and quickly drove them back to their bases. The coup plotters had hoped the staged revolt would sow panic and force people and the military to lose faith in the Prince, facilitating the coup but instead Prince Sihanouk remained in power. Desperate, some military officers involved in the plot did try to launch a coup, but they failed and as they are interrogated, the full details and participants are being revealed. Mass arrests and detentions are expected to follow."

 #Soviet Khruschev
 destalinization.0.d:0 "The ascension of Nikita Khrushchev to the position of General Secretary of the Soviet Union marked the beginning of a new era. Khrushchev quickly decided he needed to relax the Stalin era repression, control, and aggressive foreign policy. Khrushchev is able to embark on this ambitious project of transforming Soviet society due to his ability to ally with powerful factions and place loyal supporters throughout the Soviet system. His background as a peasant also aids in his credibility. However, as Khrushchev works to undo the worst aspects of the previous regime, he will have to deal with ambitious rivals and staunch Stalinists who do not appreciate this campaign of openness, especially towards enemies of the state. Khrushchev believes an era of de-Stalinization will revitalize the Soviet Union in its struggle against the capitalist world."
 Khruschev.100.d:0 "Following the death of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev was able to mobilize his supporters more effectively than his rivals and secure power. Through an alliance with senior Red Army commanders and his appointment of young proteges to key appointments, Khrushchev outmaneuvered the conservative hardliners within the inner circle of Stalin. Prominent Stalinists like Lavrenty Beria have been purged while others were placed in the background before slowing being pushed into retirement. To replace these men Khrushchev has began promoting young, ambitious men who share his vision for Soviet society. Although these men may prove a challenge down the road, at the moment Khrushchev is successfully removing the hardliners and powerful old guard with a younger, loyal cadre of supporters who are years away from challenging him."
 Lysenko.1.d:0 "For decades the agricultural and biological theories of Trofim Lysenko have been the only acceptable theories on agricultural development. These theories, called Lysenkoism condemned geneticists and more scientific methods of agriculture as being capitalistic and incorrect. It rejected the concept of natural selection and the idea of the gene. With the approval of Stalin, Lysenko supporters detained thousands of biologists and geneticists. Any criticism of his work was condemned and punishable by arrest. However, in recent years the Soviet government, following the death of Stalin, has halted its support for Lysenko and now publications, including those associated with the state, are openly condemning Lysenkoism. This shift is being attributed to the new relaxation on censorship laws and many universities are now bring back scientific agriculturists and downgrading or removing Lysenkoism from the curriculum."
 destalinization.1.d:0 "In an address to the Central Committee, Nikita Khrushchev condemned what occurred during the Leningrad Affair. The Leningrad Affair was a purge of leading Leningrad Soviet officials by Stalin and his security services. At the time it was portrayed to the Soviet people as a plot by the Leningrad officials to seize power. Khrushchev in his remarks noted the charges against the Leningrad Soviet officials were either faked or fabricated by Levrenty Beria under the direction of Joseph Stalin. He called on the rehabilitation of the surviving victims of the Leningrad Affair and in his remarks criticized several powerful Stalinists in the Central Committee. Khrushchev has not only brought to light the victims of a false purge by Stalin but by implicating those Stalinists still sitting in the Committee, including his rival Malenkov, he has weakened them and strengthened his own position."
 VLC.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union agriculture sector has long been an area of concern for the government. Under Stalin, forced collectivization sought to keep peasants to the land but this harsh policy often led to disappointing yields, heavy loss of life, and peasant discontent. The regime of Nikita Khrushchev has decided on am ambitious project, called the Virgin Lands Campaign to greatly expand Soviet agricultural productivity by cultivating millions of hectares of previously uncultivated land. These proposed lands are located in lands east of the Volga to Western Siberia. In addition, Khrushchev will expand on agricultural reform policies to encourage productivity and improve the conditions of farmers. The ambitious plan has detractors concerned over costs and feasibility but Khrushchev will not be deterred from his goal to lead an agricultural revolution. The government has launched an aggressive propaganda campaign targeting young Soviet citizens to move as settlers to these lands out of patriotic duty. So far the response has been very positive."
 destalinization.2.d:0 "The new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev seeks to consolidate his rule and end what he views as the destructive policies of the Stalin era. As part of this effort, Khrushchev has ordered the release of millions of political prisoners from the dreaded Gulag prisons. Khrushchev noted many of those condemned were sent for very minor offenses or had served their time but were not released. The news has been well received across the Soviet Union, especially from party members, many of whom have friends or family that were sent to these camps under the order of Stalin. On a more practical level, he number of prisoners had grown to dangerously high levels and many reports of riots or uprisings from prisoners had been reaching Moscow. Khrushchev hopes to alleviate this potential unrest and gain political credit from many in the Soviet Union who applaud this action."
 #Sov_Missle.1.d:0 "With the Soviet Union expanding its nuclear arsenal and delivery systems, the Ministry of Defense has decided to establish a Strategic Missile Force (SMF) as a military branch of the Soviet Union. The SMF will oversee all Soviet ballistic missiles, their organization, positioning, and will also be testing new rocket systems. New formations are expected to be organized under the SMF and the Soviets hope this branch will streamline development, production, and deployment of missiles. This new military branch reflects the increasing importance of strategic military weapons and the importance such assets have. Internationally, the SMF will be closely scrutinized as a model for how other nations with such weapons systems may week to organize them."
 Baikonur.1.d:0 "As the Soviet Union expands its ballistic missile program and engages in the development of new systems, the need for a test and launch side has grown. To resolve this need, the Soviet government has opened a new rocket test and launch site in southern Kazakhstan called the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The massive facility (coving 90 km) required the construction of new infrastructure and a new town to accommodate the required staff. More significantly, as the facility comes into operation, the Soviets have also designated the site as the main spaceport for the Soviet Union. Technology and rockets for the space program will be developed and launched from the facility as well. The facility is located close to the equator and its weather is said to be ideal for future rocket and space launches. The facility is being kept under intense security and secrecy to protect Soviet aerospace and rocket developments from hostile foreign powers."
 KGB.1.d:0 "The Soviet government had decided to reorganize its intelligence agencies and have established the Committee for State Security, or KGB. In the past, Soviet intelligence leaders have consolidated excessive power that at times threatened the Soviet state. This new organization is expected to prevent power accumulation and streamline not just domestic but also foreign intelligence operations. Different types of intelligence and regions will be headed by individual directorates who all answer to the chairman. This structural setup will prevent any one official from consolidating power and improve the efficiency of intelligence collection. The organization is acting as a successor to the successful World War II era NKVD and is expected to play a major role in securing communist rule and supporting communist efforts across the globe.."
 SOV_COL.1.d:0 "The long-oppressed peasants in Colombia have recently begun to organize themselves against capitalist exploitation. Their organization is called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC. FARC has started an armed struggle in response to the exploitation but also the political repression in Colombia which has seen populists and socialists silenced through violence. Soviet intelligence assesses the organization has potential and embraces socialist values. With this in mind, the Soviet Union has decided to send military aid to FARC and help it in its struggle. Soviet aid will even the odds and help the peasants defend themselves from the capitalist and violent Colombian state. Expanding Soviet influence in Colombia will also allow the Soviets to project its power in the western hemisphere."
 SOV_ALG.1.d:0 "The French have long exploited and abused the people of Algeria with their colonial project. Now the Algerians are fighting back with their organization, the National Liberation Front or FLN. The FLN organizes peasants and other exploited people and leads them in an armed struggle against a violent French military bolstered by local collaborators. The FLN promises a new regime of socialism and economic equality for Algeria. To aid this effort, the Soviet Union has agreed to begin offering aid to the FLN. Soviet support will be crucial in helping the Algerians standup against the modern French military. More importantly for the Soviets, undermining French rule and gaining Algerian support could prove vital in the long-term. More significantly, aiding the FLN confirms with the Soviets longstanding opposition to imperialism and its exploitation of colonized peoples."
 SovFlySub.1.d:0 "During the late 1930s the Soviet Navy explored the idea of designing and testing a plane which could then submerge, this was called the Flying Submarine Program. It was headed by engineer Boris Ushakov and although the program had early support, it was shelved before 1940 as the Navy concluded the proposed aircraft was unfeasible. However, the Soviets, under the direction of Lavrenity Beria restarted the program after the war ended. The Soviets recently built a test aircraft and the results are being assessed. Ideally, the flying submarine could potentially play a role in targeting vital enemy shipping. However, it appears the issue with the aircraft is its weight. More significantly, as enemies of Beria come to increasing prominence within the Soviet leadership, it appears unlikely that they will continue a program he started."
 TU_114.1.d:0 "At the recent World Exhibition in Brussels, the Soviets revealed a new passenger airline, the TU-114. This massive passenger aircraft is capable of transoceanic flights, has sleeping berths for passengers, and is the fastest propeller plane in history, capable of matching the speeds of jet airliners. The Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, eager to showcase this brilliant Soviet technology has decided to fly the plane on his visit to the United States. Although privately senior Soviet officials were concerned of trusting an aircraft still under development, Khrushchev insisted on taking it. Upon its arrival many in the international press were impressed by its size and capabilities, claiming it superior to any Western passenger plane currently in the market. The flight of the TU-114 has ended up being a major success for Khrushchev and his campaign to showcase Soviet ingenuity to the world."
 Khruschev_Agri.1.d:0 "The Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev comes from a peasant background and has viewed revolutionizing agriculture as a principle goal of his. However, he has chosen to ignore the advice of leading agriculturists, many of whom stated the government needed to invest heavily in agriculture and instead listen to Trofim Lysenko. Lysenko, a favorite of Stalin, has promised to create record agricultural growth with limited investment. The methods of Lysenko reject modern scientific methods, specifically from geneticists and botanists. Khrushchev, like Stalin believes his arguments. Unlike Stalin however, Khrushchev has not purged or detained those who oppose Lysenko and has allowed scientists to openly criticize him. However, despite the scientific critiques and the lack of results from what Lysenko has promised, Khrushchev continues to rely on continuing his traditional methods of Soviet agriculture."
 cpsu.20.d:0 "The twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concluded after meeting for over ten days. This is the first conference held under the leadership of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and he chose to make the Congress a condemnation of the Stalin-era purges and violence. Khrushchev on the last day of the Congress laid this out in a secret speech entitled On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences. In the speech Khrushchev accused Stalin of having a cult of personality and criticized his purges over imagined threats. The speech also implicated senior Soviet officials at the time who were instrumental in helping Stalin carry out his purges. The reaction to the speech has been mixed, many praise Khrushchev for speaking the truth while many hardliners or devotees to Stalin, the successful wartime Soviet leader, have accused Khrushchev of revisionism. News of the speech is expected to shake the communist world to its core."
 Doctors_Plot.10.d:0 "During his speech condemning the Stalin era purges, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev revealed the famous purge of doctors which occurred shortly before the death of Stalin was actually based on fabricated evidence. He stated the doctors were innocent and were only saved by the death of Stalin. Khrushchev stated that Stalin had told the judge trying the case to give guilty verdicts and beat the doctors for false confessions. More significantly, Khrushchev linked the plot to the antisemitism of Stalin along with the fabricated plot being the first step in a party-wide purge. The revelations by Khrushchev have stunned many as the press, under the direction of Stalin, had made the case major news across the country. Critics of Khrushchev note he was a senior member during this time and was complacent with the plot. They suggest he is only speaking up now as a means to strengthen his political position."
 APG_Fail.1.d:0 "Following the public denouncing of Stalin by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, he has provoked a lot of anger from Stalinist era officials and others who view Khrushchev as hypocritical considering his senior position during the purges he criticized. A faction of these men has formed a cabal that included Gregory Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Dmitri Shepilov, among others. The group tried to depose Khrushchev in a dramatic meeting of the Central Committee in which Khrushchev called the group the Anti Party Group. Before the vote took place, the Soviet defense minister, war hero General Georgy Zhukov threatened to destroy the Anti Party Group even if their vote succeeded due to their crimes under Stalin. However, the vote failed, and Khrushchev had to decide where to demote the Anti Party Group members to."
 KhruschevRel.1.d:0 "Born a peasant, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev always viewed religion with suspicion. He deeply embraced the Marxist critique of religion and saw it as a principle threat to the enlightenment and socialist development of the people. Khrushchev saw the lifting of religious restrictions during World War II as a mistake and upon taking power has launched a new wave of crackdowns on the Russian Orthodox Church. Many churches are being shut down, attendees of church services are being recorded, parents are restricted on what religion they may teach children, and children are banned from attending services. In addition to these new restrictions, priests violating any of the regulations are being swiftly arrested while those vocalizing complaints are also facing questions or detention by the state."
 KhruschevRel.2.d:0 "As part of the anti-religious campaign of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet government is closing a record number of Russian monasteries. Any members who complain or do not obey orders to shutdown are being arrested and prosecuted by the state for disobeying the law. In addition, the new regulations ban pilgrimages, which has hit some of the more popular monasteries. These closures are part of a wider crackdown on the Russian Orthodox Church. Sources in the government indicate the Soviet government maybe looking to close two-thirds of the existing churches from when Khrushchev came to power. The government states it is simply enforcing already established laws and point out the church has contacts with foreign groups and can act to undermine the Soviet Union from the inside."
 APG_Fail.2.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich and Dmitri Shepilov were both senior party members involved in the recent attempt to depose Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. They had attempted to vote him out of power during the Central Committee meeting but the vote failed and they were defeated. After losing the vote, both Kaganovich and Sepilov have been sent to small industrial institutions beyond the Urals as punishment. These former senior party members have been greatly reduced in status and position. However, Khrushchev noted that if they had attempted what they did to Stalin the punishment would have been far worse. Time will tell if these two men can ever be reconciled with Moscow or if this marks the end of their careers."
 APG_Fail.3.d:0 "Vyacheslav Molotov, one of the leaders of the recent attempt to depose Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev has been appointed the Soviet ambassador to Mongolia. This is punishment for his role in the plot after the Central Committee voted against deposing Khrushchev. The former Foreign Minister of Stalin and long-term senior Soviet leader has been banished and humiliated by this appointment. Khrushchev believes this is just punishment for his attempted overthrow and noted that under Stalin the punishment would have been far worse. Although Molotov has been defeated and the Stalinist era continues to be assailed by the Khrushchev government, he remains convinced that he and Stalin acted in the best interests of the Soviet people."
 Khruschev_yug.1.d:0 "Relations with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia deteriorated rapidly after World War II. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin tried to force Yugoslavian President Josip Tito to obey his dictates. Tito refused and after several hostile letters to one another the relationship remained very cold. However, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev has made reconciliation and positive relations with Yugoslavia a major objective of his foreign policy of friendlier relations. Khrushchev recently visited Belgrade and despite Tito initially showing hostility, a breakthrough was achieved and both men agreed to re-establish closer cooperation between the two communist states. Although the trip was a success, there are rumblings among other communist parties in the world that Khrushchev is reconciling with a regime that has a track-record of implementing a liberal communism. Supporters of Khrushchev counter that unifying the entire communist world is important in order to prevent capitalist exploitation of divisions."
 sinosovietsplit.1.d:0 "Upon taking power, the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sought to continue strengthening ties with the communist Chinese government. Soviet experts, aid, and weapons have greatly aided the Chinese in their efforts to rebuild the country following decades of war. However, recently the relationship has begun to breakdown following the decision by Khrushchev to de-Stalinize and condemn his predecessor publicly. In addition, the Chinese opposed Soviet efforts to improve ties with the West and with communist states seen as failing to implement proper Marxist-Leninist regimes. This tension came to a boil during a recent visit by Khrushchev to China, resulting in the Soviet leader leaving early. It finally ended in the Soviets withdrawing their advisors and China downgrading ties after the recent Romanian Communist Party Congress where both nations took public shots at one another. This Sino-Soviet Split marks a major division in the communist world and many fear the West may seek to exploit this to their advantage."

 #Kuomintang
 KMT.10.d:0 "In the Republic of China, the ruling Kuomintang party has announced it will expel Lei Chen, a former presidential advisor and founder of the periodical Free China. Although Free China was founded as an independent publication free to discuss issues openly and act as a contrast to the harshness of the communist controlled media, the Kuomintang has found recent publications in Free China to be dangerous. Specifically, several articles have criticized the Kuomintang for not following constitutional procedures, especially in terms of term limits and the government felt Lei Chen was behind these criticisms. Lei Chen is a noted supporter of the constitution even at the expense of the Kuomintang and it appears this stance has cost him his party membership. He is expected to continue to champion his beliefs but now from outside the party."
 Formosa.10.d:0 "The 228 Movement refers to the mass killings and brutal suppression of Taiwanese protesters by the Kuomintang-controlled Republic of China on February 28th 1947. Protests against corruption and the assault of a widow by state officials resulted in the deployment of troops who killed thousands to end the protests. It also instigated a harsh campaign of repression against the Taiwanese people who were forbidden from discussing or remembering the events. This all increased tensions between the Taiwanese and mainland Chinese. Many Taiwanese have not forgotten and continue to see the events as a clear example of the corruption and brutality of the mainland Chinese Kuomintang. They also see it as proof as to why Taiwan must be free and independent to control its own destiny."
 Formosa.11.d:0 "In a stunning development in the Republic of China, the ruling government has collapsed to an uprising led by Taiwanese resentful at the domination and control of their island following the arrival of the Kuomintang from mainland China after their defeat during the Chinese Civil War. In previous days, across the island, especially in the capital Taipei, thousands took to the street. The government deployed police and military with orders to end the protests through violence but this only caused more people to join the protests. When the government ordered troops to use live weapons, this saw many troops refuse and join the uprising. Without the support of the military, the government surrendered with many fleeing to friendly diplomatic missions or the airport in order to seek protection or flee. Newspapers in the country have announced the success of the Formosan Revolution."
 Formosa.12.d:0 "The recent Formosan Revolution saw the island population from before the arrival of the Kuomintang in 1945 finally take control of the island for themselves. The successful revolutionaries recently announced the establishment of a new Provisional Government of Formosa to transition the island to a new era of inclusive and just governance. In the upheaval, some former government officials and supporters managed to flee but a large number remains on the island, especially refugees who fled mainland China and the communists there. For now, the new government has stated these people will be watched closely, those who committed crimes will be dealt with and once the government establishes itself it will decide what to do with the refugees. The statement was not seen as reassuring by the refugees and many Kuomintang supporters are also concerned about the sacred mission of liberating the mainland."
 Formosa.100.d:0 "The new state of Formosa recently announced in a national broadcast that it has rescinded all claims to mainland China. It stated the nation would no longer be devoting its efforts and sacrificing its resources for a cause that held little importance beyond the refugees and Kuomintang loyalists. Formosa is only concerned about the welfare, safety, and development of its own people. They added their hope that by washing its hand of these land claims it hopes to establish friendly, neighborly ties with the communist Chinese regime but it remains committed to defending its borders from aggression. A formal response from Beijing has not come but many analysts believe the Formosa announcement will likely not change the stance of the mainland Chinese government that the island is a province of China and should be returned to the country."
 KMT.110.d:0 "The Republic of China (ROC) and its ruling Kuomintang party welcomed a Presidential visit from American President [USA.GetLeader]. The visit to the capital is being intensely publicized by the island press to highlight the level of international support the ROC can count on in its struggle to liberate China. The two countries are expected to discuss expanding defense cooperation, trade, and the regional security environment. President [USA.GetLeader] is will meet leading government officials and is expected to visit cultural sites across the country. The communist Chinese government released its own statement condemning the United States for interfering with the internal affairs of China and reiterated that it would soon bring the rebellious island back. In a response, a ROC politician condemned the mainland statement and added that the visit legitimizes the Kuomintang government and will help silence critics of its goals."
 KMT.201.d:0 "Today in the island of Taiwan a coup d'etat took place against Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, according to authorities and military representatives, General Sun-Li Jen, one of the Republic of China's finest generals and leaders, conducted a military coup to depose what he claims to be "A failed leader that is disgraceful to the Chinese nation". Being favored by the Americans, many claim that the coup was backed by the CIA and by the U.S. President, but these claims have not had any, hitherto, any backing whatsoever; it seems it will be a rumor among a plethora of rumors in the deposition of Chiang."
 KMT.150.d:0 "The Rommel of the East, military general Sun-Li Jen was taken by the authorities today under the orders of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek; claiming the former was planning a military coup to depose and oppress the Chinese in Taiwan, Kai-Shek has vowed to dish out severe punishment to the General, being accused of several negligence in allowing his subordinates to participate in a revolt involving Communist agents; At the moment the general is in house arrest, awaiting a future fate."
 
 #Bulgarian 1950s
 AntiRevBul.1.d:0 "The recent campaign of de-Stalinization and peaceful cooperation with non-communist states by the Soviet government has provoked a rise in anti-revisionist critique in Bulgaria. Critics of the new Soviet policies have condemned the Soviets for being revisionists.  and a threat to the proper implementation of Marxist-Leninist ideology. Even more significantly, the policy of Moscow to promote peaceful coexistence with the global capitalist powers and improving ties with communist states who do not fully embrace Marxist-Leninism is seen as weakening the revolution. The anti-revisionist critiques are spreading quickly in Bulgaria and is putting pressure on the Bulgarian Communist Party to openly criticize the Soviet Union and continue its practices. However, the party recognizes the continued need to Soviet support and is expected to reform leadership and governance along the new Soviet approach."
 Bul_Purge.1.d:0 "The Bulgarian government announced the execution of Anton Yugov for betraying the Bulgarian Communist Party and its ideology. This comes amid the background of a major purge within Bulgaria. Following the lead of the Soviet Union, Anton Yugov advocated changing the party to be more open, Bulgarian focused, and remove Stalinist influence. However, the old guard survived this new threat and remained in control of the government, rejected the idea of shifting party ideas. To solidify their continued control over the country they are purging the Bulgarian Communist Party of what they accuse as revisionists who seek to undermine the implementation of Marxist Leninism. Anton Yugov had been a senior leader of the party since World War II and served in senior posts up to his arrest and subsequent execution."
 Bul_Purge.2.d:0 "The Bulgarian government announced the execution of Todor Zhivkov for betraying the Bulgarian Communist Party and its ideology. This comes amid the background of a major purge within Bulgaria. Following the lead of the Soviet Union, Todor Zhivkov advocated changing the party to be more open, Bulgarian focused, and remove Stalinist influence. However, the old guard survived this new threat and remained in control of the government, rejected the idea of shifting party ideas. To solidify their continued control over the country they are purging the Bulgarian Communist Party of what they accuse as revisionists who seek to undermine the implementation of Marxist Leninism. Todor Zhivkov fought as a partisan during World War II and joined the party after. He held senior positions and was a staunch Stalinist hardliner until Moscow announced its new approach and rejection of Stalinist practices. However, this shift proved a mistake as the old guard retained power and has now purged him."
 Protivobalgarska.1.d:0 "The Bulgarian Communist Party has decided to reverse its post-World War II policy with regards to the Pirin Macedonia region. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had instructed Bulgaria to offer cultural autonomy to the region and recognize the population as Macedonian. This resulted in the Bulgarian state initiating a policy of declaring residents Macedonian and forcibly moving other declared Macedonians to the region in order to establish its cultural identity. Opponents to the policy were arrested or declared fascists by the state. Many residents in the region are noted as Bulgarian speakers and members of the Bulgarian church. The motivation for Macedonization were plans made to federate with Yugoslavia and the government even directed census authorities to identify the region as majority Macedonian to bridge with the neighboring Yugoslavian Macedonian region. However, now these plans have ended due to Yugoslavia splitting with Moscow and the region is being called Bulgarian once again."
 Bul_Purge.5.d:0 "Todor Zhikov has been dismissed from his positions within the Bulgarian government and is expected to be officially expelled from the Bulgarian Communist Party. The former World War II partisan leader and senior party member made a critical mistake by embracing the de-Stalinization and relaxation of state control called for by the Soviet government. Zhikov thought by following the lead of Moscow he could gain control of the party, remove the old guard, and garner public support at the same time. However, his attempt to take power in the Central Committee failed and his triumphant enemies have decided that Zhikov must be removed from the government completely. The allies of Zhikov are also expected to be removed from positions of authority in the coming weeks."
 Bul_Purge.10.d:0 "Traicho Kostov, the former head of the Bulgarian Communist Party was posthumously rehabilitated and readmitted to the party following a report by the Central Committee over the Kostov trial. Kostov had been arrested on charges of being an agent for Western intelligence agencies, undermining Soviet relations, and advocating nationalism at the expense of Marxist-Leninist unity. Following his arrest and execution, supporters of his in the party were also arrested and sentenced to long terms. The new embrace of de-Stalinization has seen the Bulgarian Communist Party re-assess these trials and establish commissions to look over these trials. They concluded that the mistake of the cult of personality led to the wrongful conviction of Kostov and his supporters. Those who were still in prison have also been released and rehabilitated as well."
 Bul_Purge.11.d:0 "The Partisan Faction within the Communist Party of Bulgaria has found its position increasingly sidelined within the party. The communist partisans who resisted the fascist regime and Axis forces were instrumental after the war in launching the communist-led coup that brought the Bulgarian Communist Party into power. The recent shift in Moscow towards de-Stalinization and peaceful cooperation has marked a shift across the communist world. In Bulgaria, this has seen the rise of a new group of leaders who advocate a change of the Stalinist old-guard and the implementation of a localized de-Stalinization within the country. This shift has resulted in the Partisan Faction losing influence and status within the party as they largely embraced the Stalinist line."
 AntiRevBul.2.d:0 "The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, in a surprise decision, announced it was embracing Anti-Revisionism. This marks a blow to the Soviet Union and its recent embrace of de-Stalinization and the friendly cooperation with capitalist states. Critics of this Soviet reversal of Stalin policies accuse Moscow of being revisionists. By embracing this position, the Bulgarian old guard has been bolstered and is expected to remain firmly in control of Bulgaria. However, the previous, warm ties between the Soviet and Bulgarian government will likely be negatively affected by this change. The Bulgarian government made it a point to mention that by embracing Anti-Revisionism, they are preserving the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the state."
 yugov.1.d:0 "The shift to de-Stalinization launched from Moscow has led the major communist parties across Europe to reassess their policies and structures. In Bulgaria, the old guard which has controlled the party since World War II by following a pro-Soviet, Stalinist line finds itself sidelined within the party. With de-Stalinization being the order of the day, the Bulgarian Communist Party announced it was appointing Anton Yugov as First Secretary. Yugo condemns the cult of personality and supports the development of a Bulgarian communism, independent of Moscow. In the past such views could have led to his removal from power and the party but with de-Stalinization embraced by the party, these views will form the basis of the party. The old-guard now faces criticism and their supporters will not view the appointment of Yugov as a productive step for the party. Yugov has also bested rivals within his camp who may have sought to take the senior leadership position for themselves."
 Bul_Purge.3.d:0 "Traicho Kostov, the former head of the Bulgarian Communist Party was executed by the Bulgarian government. He had been dismissed by the Central Committee and stripped of party membership several months ago. After his arrest, he was accused of deviating from Marxist-Leninism by embracing nationalism, undermining Soviet ties, and being an agent for Western intelligence agencies. During the trial, Kostov was not able to offer an effective defense and was swiftly found guilty. As Kostov was being tried, his supporters within the party were being arrested and put on trial as well on similar charges, they are also expected to be found guilty and sentenced to long prison sentences. Many believe the trials were show trials meant to purge the party of Kostov and his supporters and strengthen the pro-Soviet factions within the party."
 Zhivkov.1.d:0 "The new General Secretary for the Bulgarian Communist Party is Todor Zhivkov. The former partisan commander rose to senior party ranks after being placed in charge of the Sofia police force. Zhivkov managed to take the position of General Secretary due to the embrace across many communist countries of de-Stalinization after the Soviet Union announced its support of it. The old communist leadership in Bulgaria built their power along obedience to the Moscow line and Stalin but with that approach now criticized in Moscow, their position became untenable. Zhivkov managed to help maneuver the old leadership out of power and position himself as the top candidate to the position. He is expected to initiate policies and reforms to establish a Bulgarian version of communism which is hoped to not just revitalize the party but gain it support across the population."
 Bul_Purge.4.d:0 "The General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Valko Chervenkov has been removed from office. Chervenkov spent years in Moscow undergoing education and training. He led propaganda efforts during World War II and joined the government afterwards. He outmaneuvered his opponents and eventually merged his role as party chief with the position of Prime Minister. He adhered to the Soviet line of Marxist-Leninism, economic, and social development. However, the shift in Moscow towards de-Stalinization left his position untenable as Chervenkov was one of the most obedient adherents to Stalinism. With opposition in the party increasing and the popular support declining, Chervenkov had little choice but to stepdown and be removed from the government. He remains a party member but is not expected to have much of a voice with the state. A new era of Bulgarian communism has begun."
 
 ZSL.1.d:0 "The ZSL, the United People's Party, was created after a merger of the communist party Stronnictwo Ludowe and remnants of the People's Party; led by Józef Niecko, the party proclaims a view of agrarianism and agrarian socialism. It is seen and functions as a satellite party for the Communist PZPR, the Polish United Worker's Party, and the main intention of the so-called ‘satellite' is to represent the rural workers of Poland. A few Polish politicians have been praising the creation of this new party and have congratulated Józef himself for his stellar work."
 ZSL.2.d:0 "Known physician and politician Tadeusz Michejda, senator for the National Worker's Party in the 1930s and Minister of Health in Poland, has formally declared his intention to endorse the recently-created ZSL, praising the agrarian policies and the focus that the party has on rural workers, who are often overlooked in the increasingly urbanized society that Poland faces. The ZSL has thanked the politician for his praises, recognizing not only his work in Poland but, as they say, a champion of Socialism."
 Wyszynski.1.d:0 "Professor and Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski was recently arrested following a crackdown of several elements of Polish society and is now imprisoned at Rywald; the Polish government cites treasonous behavior for the ongoing wave of arrests, followed by mass trials and imprisonments. He had been recently elevated to the rank of cardinal priest by the Pope and was an avid social worker and aided several Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland, before heading a restoration project in Wloclawek post-war. Many are deeming this arrest a grave injustice against the Church and the people of Poland themselves."
 Gomulka.1.d:0 "Wladislaw Gomulka, deputy Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of Poland from January to June of 1945 and notorious Communist politician of the Polish United Worker's Party, was imprisoned due to orders from Boleslaw Bierut, the President of Poland. In what seemed to be, by experts, a long-winded power struggle between the two beacons of Communism, has finally exploded as Bierut accused Gomulka of "right-wing reactionary deviation", with no comments on the duration of the imprisonment and a subsequent expelling from the Polish United Worker's Party, Gomulka is left persecuted, imprisoned and with no political functions."

 POL_NATOLIN.1.d:0 "Word has come today from the Polish People's Republic, a satellite state of the Soviet Union and one of the most populous states in the Eastern Bloc that they are denying the Katyn Massacre. The massacre was a series of mass shootings that took place around April and May of 1940. About 22,000 Polish military officials and educated people were executed by the NKVD, while the killings occurred in Soviet prisons, the massacre is named after the Katyn forest where the first mass graves were discovered. The Soviets state that the people behind the massacre were the Germans, and have continually denied responsibility for the massacre."        #Deny the Katyn Massacre (Part of the Hardliner Route)
 POL_NATOLIN.2.d:0 "Reports are coming in from Jewish communities in the Polish People's Republic regarding discrimination, the forbidding of allowing the Jewish diaspora in Poland to return to Israel, aswell as including the arrest of numerous elite Jewish officials and intellectuals within the country. This has sparked outcry from Israel, and numerous Jewish communities in Europe begging for the fair treatment of the Jewish population in Poland. It's an all out campaign against them. Action must be taken!"        #Poland Launches Anti-Semetic Campaign (Part of the Hardliner Route)

 Gomulka.2.d:0 "In the late 1940s, our country's government was split by a rivalry between Gomulka and Bierut. Gomulka led a home national group and Bierut led a group supported by the Soviet Union. It eventually led to the removal of Gomulka from power in 1948. He was accused of right wing reactionary deviation, leading to his imprisonment for over eight years, from 1949 to 1956. But now with increasing riots in Poznan, we're being forced to rehabilitate Gomulka. The reformers in the PZPR want political rehabilitation and his return to party leadership, and Gomulka wants real power to implement reforms. We don't really have a choice in the matter."            #Gomulka Released from Prison
 Gomulka.3.d:0 "With the raging protests in the city of Poznan, increasing outcries from civilians and members of the cabinet have called for real action. Now that Zawadzki has assumed the role of First Secretary, with the full backing of our comrades in the Soviet Union, we have begun suppressing the protests with the help of the army and the secret police. Numerous arrests have been made, but most importantly of all. Gomulka, an old reformer who was rehabilitated has been arrested once again. Maybe this will show him and the protestors that reform isn't needed, and our populace needs to learn to live with it! After all, all we had to do was kick in the door with his arrest, and the whole protest will come crashing down."            #Gomulka Arrested Oncemore (Aftermath of Zawadzki becoming Secretary instead of Gomulka)

 Polish_October.0.d:0 "The People’s Polish Republic has declared a period of national mourning for the death of First Secretary Boleslaw Bierut. First Secretary Boleslaw Bierut died from a heart attack yesterday within the Soviet capital, Moscow. Nearly a month before Bierut was attending the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as part of the Polish delegation in February, however, instead of returning to Poland with the rest of the Polish delegation Bierut stayed to be hospitalized in Moscow due to a case of Influenza. Bierut's Influenza would eventually cause Pneumonia and heart complications which would lead to Bierut’s heart attack. Church bells would ring across the Polish nation on the day of Bierut’s funeral, which would also be attended by the First Secretary of the Soviet Union. Four days after Bierut’s funeral the PZPR would host its 6th Plenum to determine a successor to Bierut. At the PZPR's 6th Plenum Edward Ochab would be unanimously elected by the PZPR Central Committee as the new First Secretary, as a compromise candidate between the reformist Pulawy faction and the Stalinist hardliner Natolin faction."
 Polish_October.1.d:0 "Recent reports show a change in the political climate in Poland. It's being called the Polish Thaw or the Polish October. The hard-line Stalinist faction has lost popularity and with protests earlier in June, it highlighted the dissatisfaction and overall discomfort the people had with their situation and rule. The events resulted in the rise of the reformers' faction, led by Wladyslaw Gomulka. Gomulka is enthusiastically supported by the great majority of society in Poland, not primarily as a communist leader, but as a leader of a nation who resisted Soviet pressure and Stalin's totalitarian rule."    #Polish October (global)
 Polish_October.2.d:0 "With tensions cooling in the Polish People's Republic in the aftermath of Polish October Wladyslaw Gomulka has assumed leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader once again after Bierut passed away. Gomulka has been initially very popular for his reforms and his seeking of a "Polish way to socialism" which is giving rise to the period known as "Gomulka's thaw". Perhaps this will lead to a period of peace, prosperity, and reform in one of the Eastern Bloc's largest nations?"    #First Secretary Gomulka(global)
 Polish_October.3.d:0 "\nWith Bierut's passing the position of First Secretary of the Polish People's Republic is now occupied by Aleksander Zawadzki. He was Deputy Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Poland and was appointed chairman of the Polish Council of State, to replace Boleslaw Bierut who had taken the position of First Secretary. With Bierut's passing, Zawadzki has detailed his plan to align the country more towards the Soviet Union and integrate more parts of Soviet culture in the nation."    #First Secretary Zawadzki (Alternative Hardliner to Gomulka) (global)

#Country Events
 Sect_Crisis.1.d:0 "Several months ago, the Binh Xuyen, a political force in Saigon with a stronghold on organized crime, allied with two sects, the Buddhist Hoa Hao and the syncritic Cao Dai formed a United Front against the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem. The three organizations have strong bases of supporters and control their own paramilitary forces. Diem refused their demands for a more inclusive government. Instead he stacked the government with his own loyalists and Catholics. His refusal to share power and nepotism raised tensions. This boiled into open warfare after Diem announced he would replace the Saigon police chief, a member of the Binh Xuyen. This latest provocation pushed the United Front to launch an attack to takeover the country and end the incompetence of Diem. The United Front argues that the policies of Diem weaken national unity and will facilitate the communist threat. In response, Diem called on the army to deploy its forces to Saigon and combat the sects."
 diem_exile.1.d:0 "Following the Battle of Saigon, the United Front successfully deposed South Vietnam leader Ngo Dinh Diem and his government. Although there were many who advocated his execution or imprisonment, it was clear such an action would further divide the South Vietnamese people. During talks to form a government of national unity, Catholic and conservative leaders both pointed out a harsh treatment of Diem would end any hopes of a unified government. As a result, the United Front announced it would instead exile Ngo Dinh Diem from the country. Diem is expected to land in Manilla, but the final location for his exile has not been decided. Many believe he will choose either France or the United States. His family is expected to eventually join him."
 Anti_Reffernedum.1.d:0 "The Geneva Accords had committed the two governments in Vietnam to hold elections within their borders to create a unified Vietnamese state. However, the South Vietnam government has announced it will not hold such a referendum. The government cited a recently completed referendum on the type of government the people of South Vietnam would like and stated the results clearly showed a rejection to the communist system. In addition, they claimed the totalitarian, oppressive regime in Hanoi could not be trusted to hold fair elections, especially since they actively supported violent unrest. The North Vietnam government called out Saigon for betraying their commitments and stated it would continue to support the Vietnamese people and their sacred mission of unification. The United States was quick to announce its support for South Vietnam and agreed a referendum at this time would be unproductive."
 Diem.50.d:0 "General Nguyen Van Vy was a highly decorated officer of the South Vietnam army. Trained as an officer by the French, he fought several major battles against the communist Viet Minh. He became a part of the national army in South Vietnam following the final French withdrawal. General Nguyen Van Vy recognized that Ngo Dinh Diem was seeking to seize political power for himself and remove Emperor Bao Dai. He felt if Diem was not stopped, this would further weaken the South Vietnam state and ultimately help the communists in their efforts to seize the country. He acted by trying to seize control of the army and detain Diem in the name of the emperor. However, this attempt failed, and he was arrested by Diem loyalists. The general has been stripped of his rank and has fled to France."
 Can_Lao.1.d:0 "Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu officially established a new political party called the Can Lao Party. Nhu, who is also the closest advisor to his brother Diem, declared the party would guide Vietnam to a glorious future away from the decadence of French colonialism and the oppression of communism. He said his Personal Dignity Theory would be the ideology of the party. The theory emphasizes personalism, spiritualism, and Nhu claims it offers a third way for the people of Vietnam. The new party unifies all the groups Diem has united over the years, especially among the Catholics, anti-communists, and conservative anti-colonial groups. The new party is expected to greatly enhance the ability of Diem to unify, mobilize, and expand his diverse base of supporters."
 VIE_Negotiations.1.d:0 "The government of South Vietnam has decided to approach Hanoi and seek negotiations. The South Vietnam government believes it is in its best interest to seek some sort of understanding or resolution with North Vietnam. Many in South Vietnam feel a policy of defiance and antagonism towards North Vietnam only provokes instability, bitterness, and escalating violence. They have told North Vietnam for the sake of all Vietnamese; they must open talks to resolve their outstanding issues before the situation reaches a point of no return. News of the South Vietnam decision has provoked an angry reaction from Washington who have told Saigon that such a decision indicates weakness and greatly hinders the ability of South Vietnam to handle the communist threat."
 Vietnam_Mon.1.d:0 "Prince Cuong De, a lifelong anti-colonial, revolutionary Vietnamese nationalist has been coronated Emperor of Vietnam. He had spent many years organizing uprisings and living in exile due to his strong devotion to the anti-colonial struggle. He has many admirers in Vietnam, and it is felt his coronation will make the monarchy a viable option for many across the country. He stated he had to take over as Emperor due to the actions of his predecessor who continuously failed the people of Vietnam in the struggle against France. Although his wartime support of Japan has made him the subject of criticism in many quarters, he has strong bases of support, especially among the Cao Dai sect who have longed advocated his occupation of the throne as the means to prevent the destruction of the monarchy and the traditional customs of the Vietnamese people."


#News Events
 Sect_Crisis.2.d:0 "The three sects of the United Front proved quite divided, especially their paramilitary units and the lack of coordination prevented decisive, early action during the Battle of Saigon. Loyal military units of Ngo Dinh Diem arrived and engaged rebels in vicious street fighting. The sects replied with mortar fire and received clandestine French aid. However, the United States decided it would back Diem and once the South Vietnamese military heard this, more units quickly arrived, bringing heavy artillery to turn the tide against the sects. After several days of intense fighting, the government of Ngo Dinh Diem proved victorious as its troops captured all the major strongholds of the sects. With the endorsement of the United States and his military victory, Diem appears triumphant in Saigon. Several major sect leaders are said to have fled to France following their defeat."
 Sect_Crisis.3.d:0 "The three sects of the United Front managed to establish a unified command center early in the Battle of Saigon. This proved decisive as they were able to capture key government positions and secure several major entrances into the city, hindering the military re-enforcements of Ngo Dinh Diem. The news from Washington was unclear as the United States would not commit to supporting Diem which saw several of his army commanders refuse to deploy forces against the sects. The heavy street fighting saw the sects gain the upper hand and drive Diem and his supporters out of the city. With the sects now in control of Saigon, they have called on the people to come together and help them form a new government of national unity."
 Operation_to_Freedom.d:0 "The agreement to end the fighting in Vietnam and divide the state into two governments stipulated a three-hundred-day period in which the local population can freely move to either nation. Both the French and the new South Vietnamese government thought the numbers of refugees would be limited but it quickly became clear the number was much more than ten times their estimates. Many Catholics feared communist anti-religious doctrine and sought to move south, straining French resources. The United States has decided to step in to help the evacuation in what is being called Operation Passage to Freedom. In addition to providing ships and planes, the United States is also providing much needed aid to the refugees. The operation is a huge public relations success and propaganda victory for South Vietnam and the United States. They point at the massive number of refugees as a clear indication of the preference people in Vietnam have for non-communist rule."
 Diem.10.d:0 "\nFollowing the recent referendum, which stated ninety-eight percent of the voters wanted a republic over a monarchy, South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem announced the abolishment of the monarchy. Although the referendum was highly suspect, with many reports of ballot stuffing and rules which forbid campaigning for the monarchy, the Emperor has decided to go into exile. This removes him as the Head of State and Diem is expected to take the title for himself. The Nguyen Dynasty had ruled since the early nineteenth century but the decision of the Emperor after World War II to abdicate in favor of the Viet Minh marked the monarchy as a target for the anti-communist Diem. Although the emperor abdicated, he still had symbolic significance for many Vietnamese and critics of Diem have been quick to point out that abolishing the monarchy will weaken national unity in the face of communist aggression."
 Diem.11.d:0 "\nSouth Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem announced the establishment of the Republic of Vietnam. He announced this marked the end of colonialism, monarchism, and the threat of communism. Diem stated the Republic of Vietnam was a bastion of freedom and would be base from which a unified, democratic Vietnam will eventually emerge. Although the government has been quick to praise the referendum and what it means, there were reports of widespread voter fraud and ballot stuffing. North Vietnam called the results a farce by a puppet regime. Critics within South Vietnam noted by ending the monarchy and proclaiming a republic, Diem had broken national connection many across Vietnam felt towards the Emperor. Despite these criticisms, large celebrations could be heard in pro-Diem neighborhoods in Saigon and the United States said it would quickly recognize the new government."
 Diem.12.d:0 "The leader of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem openly rejected the Geneva Accords and stated his government would not be bound to them. Diem noted South Vietnam had not formally signed the agreement and that it did not offer any mechanism for how elections on unification were to be held. He also pointed out the communist regime in North Vietnam had established such a totalitarian and oppressive atmosphere that there existed no way for free elections to be held there. Although France has stated its hopes in the implementation of the Accords and had been essential in securing the South Vietnam state, it is being replaced by the United States which supports the stance of Diem. In addition to his international support, Diem continues to solidify his control over South Vietnam politically. His rejection of the Geneva Accords reflects his confidence in his ability to crush communist fighters within his borders."
 Tay_Ninh.1.d:0 "Tay Ninh, the spiritual capital of the Cao Dai sect has fallen to the government of South Vietnam. Soldiers with overwhelming force seized Tay Ninh and its religious leaders are said to have fled. The Cao Dai practice a syncretic faith with many adherents, but they are also a political power with their own paramilitary force. Their recent attempt to overthrow the central government in Saigon ended in failure and to prevent the sect from regrouping, the government decided it would take Tay Ninh. The commander leading government forces announced that the capture of Tay Ninh marks the end of the Cao Dai and the government will now focus on pacifying the communist threat. Observers in Saigon note that the Cao Dai enjoy a large base of support and any attempt by the government to crackdown on the group will require a continuous effort."
 Ba_Cut.1.d:0 "Following the Battle of Saigon, the government of South Vietnam, under the leadership of Ngo Dinh Diem decided to target the bases of support and leaders of all three sects involved. Ba Cut was the leading member of the Buddhist Hoa Hao sect. A skilled military leader, Ba Cut led his forces during the Battle of Saigon, cutting off key access roads and stifling government movement. He avoided capture and continued to resist, launching armed resistance and hindering the influence of Diem officials in Hoa Hao areas. However, he was recently captured by a government patrol and his forces were subsequently defeated. Many suggested Diem should rehabilitate Ba Cut due to his military skills and anti-communism. They felt showing mercy to him would help unify the nation after the recent unrest. However, Diem let a military court sentence Ba Cut to death and subsequently executed by guillotine. Many Ba Cut supporters reacted angrily and have taken to the jungle to fight against Diem."
 Saigon_Trials.1.d:0 "The Viet Quoc government has announced more communists will be brought to trial for their counter-revolutionary and anti-national actions during the 1940s. The trials are being called the Saigon Trials by the press and many of the accused are expected to face harsh sentences for their actions. The government has listed a litany of charges, including the murder of Viet Quoc members returning to the country from China, military operations conducted against the group by communist fighters, electoral fraud, and unlawful imprisonment of Viet Quoc leaders. They claimed all these actions occurred during the struggle for independence and were blatant efforts by the communists to solidify its own power and crush non-communist freedom fighters at the expense of the anti-colonial struggle. Critics of the Viet Quoc call it an anti-communist purge through show-trials."
 Diem_Returns.1.d:0 "The United Front following its victory in the Battle of Saigon established a government of national unity. Can Lao, the party of Diem agreed it would participate in the national unity government only if Diem was exiled instead of a harsh sentence. The United Front agreed, and Can Lao joined under the leadership of Ngo Dinh Nhu, brother of the deposed Diem. The Can Lao proved to be far more organized than the other political parties and its ability to unite different factions of anti-communists along with the Catholics, allowed the party to take a dominant political position. Nhu recently announced Diem would return to South Vietnam and take control of the country again. The disunity within the United Front and the Can Lao domination of key military positions has ensured this announcement will occur with minimal resistance. The United Front has crumbled."

#Indian Events
 Dalit.1.d:0 "The Dalit Buddhism Movement under the leadership of B.R. Ambedkar plans to convert Dalits, known as untouchables, to his version of Buddhism. The goal is to convert enough Dalits to create political pressure for social change and end the influence in Dalit communities of Hinduism in keeping the community oppressed. B.R. Ambedkar, a major pro-independence activist and Dalit activist has long viewed Hinduism as the root problem for Dalit social development. The version of Buddhism he offers is called Navayana, which views the religion through the prism of class struggle and rejects many mainstream Buddhist beliefs. Upon launching his campaign, as many as half a million Dalits converted. Although the numbers are impressive, critics note the conversion rate is not as high as Ambedkar would like and the converted Dalits are not large enough to become a political force pushing for social change. Communal tensions have also risen as many Hindus find these targeted conversions as a direct threat to their community."
 India.25.d:0 "\nDuring World War II the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were under the occupation of the Free Indian Army and their Japanese patrons. They administered the islands as part of Free India and after the war surrendered it to British Indian forces. With independence, India declared its intention to see all Indians liberated from colonialism and given the choice to join the Indian Union. However, during this period the British stated it intended to move all Anglo-Indians and Anglo-Burmese to the islands and give them independence. However, this plan proved impossible to implement but raised concerns among the Indian leadership. To end any dispute on the status of these islands, the Indian government officially announced the annexation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands into the Indian Union and promised to provide the island with education and development."
 Asian_Games.1.d:0 "The first edition of the Asian Games have begun in New Delhi. Athletes from more than ten Asian nations are participating in over fifty competitions. For this first edition, communist regimes were not invited, and Pakistan was denied permission due to the conflict in Kashmir. The origins to the Asian Games can be traced to the pre-World War II Far Eastern Championship Games which ended following the start of the Sino-Japanese War. During the 1948 Olympics China and the Philippines discussed a new edition of the Far Eastern Games and the Indian representative to the International Olympic Committee agreed but suggested the scope include the newly emerging independent states in Asia. This started the process which eventually led to the formation of the Asian Athletic Association and an agreement to host the first Asian Games in New Delhi. Although Japan is not a member of the Asian Athletic Association, they have been allowed to participate."
 COM_Hyderabad.1.d:0 "For centuries the people of Hyderabad lived under the tyrannical rule of their Nizam and his cabal of landlords and servants. The Nizam utilized these men to physically crush the peasants and those who would call for reforms to develop the region. Now that India controls Hyderabad and recognizes it can rectify the historical wrongs. The Indian government announced a sweeping series of dismissals and arrests of former officials, royal advisors, and landlords who had worked closely with the Nizam of Hyderabad. These men are being punished for their past actions and as these cases go to trial, the government expects these men to surrender the wealth they stole back to the people. The government added that physically liberating Hyderabad was only one part and the next part requires the removal of reactionary classes. This will allow development and reforms to be carried out with little interference or sabotage."
 COM_Hyderabad.2.d:0 "Throughout 1947 and 1948, Operation Polo annexed the princedom of Hyderabad into the newly independent India. However, this gave rise to instability, and soon the state was overrun by a peasant uprising, supported by the Communist Party of India. The Peasants attacked the feudal landlords that had ruled over the land since ancient times, before turning their attention and the full force of their ire towards Osman Ali Khan, the ruling Prince of Hyderabad since 1911. The  brutal crushing of this violence will finally bring a close to Operation Polo, but will nowhere near end the incessant violence between Naxalites and Maoists in the region. However, it will mean that the CPI will have to bring Communism to India through the framework of democracy and should finally bring at least a semblance of order to the war torn region."
 India.6.d:0 "The Constitution of Imaraudingndia required the President to establish a commission to investigate the conditions of backward classes across the country and offer suggestions on how to end discrimination. Backward classes were identified as communities which due to religious, tribal, or socio-economic reasons were hindered from gaining representation, access to education, or jobs. The President placed this commission, called the First Backwards Classes Commission under the leadership of famed Indian independence activist Kaka Kalelkar. The commission eventually identified over two thousand backward casts and communities, of which nearly nine hundred were called most backward. It recommended socialism, reserving seats at universities for backward communities, and a social justice campaign in which those in higher castes or status renounce their advantages for the betterment of the nation. It also called on literacy and training programs for these communities."
 kashmir.100.d:0 "When bands of fighters, no doubt acting with the approval of Pakistan, entered Kashmir shortly after independence, the Indian government received a request from the Maharaja of Kashmir. He stated that his capital was on the verge of collapse to violent thugs and asked for our help. We told him if he agreed to accede Kashmir to the Indian Union then we would be able to offer help. He agreed and the Indian Army quickly arrived to save Srinagar from being sacked by the fighters. Pakistan soon revealed their overt role and deployed its own troops to Kashmir. After months of intense fighting, a UN ceasefire was agreed by both sides and India currently occupies two-thirds of what was the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir. Our presence is essential to ensuring peace and end the mass expulsion of Hindus into Jammu."
 Negar.1.d:0 "Indian patriots living in Portuguese Nagar Haveli following independence worked hard to liberate the area from colonial forces. After a brief struggle, the people were victorious, and they began administrating themselves with the help of India. However, internationally the territory was still seen as Portuguese. This ended today after a senior Indian Civil Service member was made the head of state for Negar Haveli. Once he was sworn in, he formally requested permission to join the India which the Indian government accepted. Indian forces and government officials quickly moved into the territory to begin the process of integrating the territory into India. The Portuguese have lodged a protest with the Indian government and the United Nations however, many observers believe this will have little effect on the ground."
 kashmir.101.d:0 "The Maharaja of Kashmir had acceded the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir into India in order to secure Indian aid in his efforts against the Pakistani-backed tribal fighters. The Indian Army quickly intervened and secured most of the territory for India. With the front stabilized, a legislative assembly has been established in Kashmir. This assembly recently confirmed the actions of the Maharaja and stated the people of Jammu and Kashmir approve the joining with India. This decision saw the Indian government respond by announcing it would soon begin integrating the administration and police of Kashmir with national institutions, bringing them to proper standards and procedures. Politically the Indian government also stated it would swiftly move to add Kashmir as a new national province."
 IndiaPuppet.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Nepal has long been intertwined with the history of India. Many Nepali work across India and their famed Gurkha soldiers are among the most elite of the Indian Army. It is this close, historical bond which the Indian government states is the reason why they have demanded Nepal accept Indian hegemony. The Indian government Nepal is essentially a princely state and as such must work out its status with New Delhi not London. The Indian government also stated that while the Nepali government claims it is independent, the people of Nepal deeply desire a union with India. The Indians emphasized that Nepal would have no functioning economy or access to globe without India. The Nepali government is expected to respond soon though many observers believe they will accept the Indian demands, despite their misgivings."
 IndiaPuppet.2.d:0 "The Indian government has announced Bhutan will enter into a deeper partnership with Bhutan giving India access to the country along with a voice over its foreign and domestic politics. The Indian government stated Bhutan is essentially a princely state and has long been dependent on India in terms of its security, economy, and development. The new arrangement reflects the historical reality. More significantly, the Indian government noted that the people of Bhutan will now be protected from the machinations of hostile neighbors. Observers of this recent action believe the Indian move reflects a desire by India to secure its borders and have a buffer space in case a rival power seeks to challenge India to the north."
 IndiaPuppet.3.d:0 "The Tibetan government announced its excitement for the new arrangement it has made with the Indian government. The statement is viewed with skepticism across the world as essentially Tibet agreed to surrender its foreign policy, defense, and economy to Indian control in exchange for the protection of the Indian military. Some reports already state Indian military units have moved into Tibet. The Indian government in its own statement noted the recent agreement fits the historical ties between India and Tibet which stretch back centuries. Many observers believe this Indian intervention in Tibet is meant to give them a strong buffer zone to defend the Indian plains from any future threat from the north. For the Tibetans, although their sovereignty has been reduced, they believe that cost is worth securing protection against potential aggression from its own neighbors, many of whom have territorial designs on Tibet."
 IndiaPuppet.4.d:0 "The French have had enclaves in South Asia since the seventeenth century. With the independence of India, the people in the French areas have demanded union with the new state. The French in turn decided to allow elections in the areas to determine what the people desire. Following these results, all the French enclaves have been ceded to Indian jurisdiction. The Indian government is already dispatching officials and administrators to smoothly transition the former French territory into the country. Some of these territories will be incorporated into neighboring provinces but the main French area, Pondichery will be administrated as a Union Territory. Another colonial power in India has been driven out and the Indian Union grows stronger. The mission to end colonialism in South Asia continues successfully."
