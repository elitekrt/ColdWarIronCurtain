 DDR_Harich.1.d:0 "The aversion against the Stalinist Soviet occupation of East Germany has boiled over and resulted in a takeover by the Harich Group. Germans across the country, outraged at the persecution of the group, have risen up. The court where the Harish Group members were being held has been overrun and the members have been freed. The NKVD camps have been stormed and general strikes have placed the country into a deadlock.\nFrom the chaos, the Harich Group has taken de facto control over the country and promised to bring liberal reforms to the country. Already, Stalinist loyalists have begun to flee the country fearing that they may be killed by the rebellious Harich supporters."
 DDR_Harich.10.d:0 "Desiring the unity and particularist autonomy of the German people, the East German government has called for Pan-German elections. Citing that the German people no longer wish to be controlled by foreign powers but rather be free to govern themselves, the East German government has pledged its support for these elections. The East German government has also outlined a series of plans on how these elections will work and properly represent the will of the German people.\nWhile Germans support this proposal fervently, it has drawn internal division within’ the 2 sphere who are skeptical that it would be within’ their best interests. Both sides have yet to release official statements or positions on the matter."
 ulbricht_purge.1.d:0 "Walter Ulbricht, the First Secretary of the German Democratic Republic, has been executed on the order of Politburo of the Central Committee. Soon after the death of Stalin, massive riots broke out across the country. The pro-Stalinist leaders have failed to contain the riots and they have become a full revolution, deposing the pro-Stalinist government.\nHeinrich Rau, the Chairman of the Economic Commission and Wilhelm Zaisser, the head of Stasi have become the de facto leaders. Immediately after gaining power, both Rau and Zaisser accused Ulbricht to be a traitor to the German people and a puppet installed by the Soviets to manipulate German workers into following a defunct sect of Marxism. Ulbricht was given a very long trial with extensive representation and has been found guilty of conspiring against the German people. Fearing Ulbricht’s supporters may attempt to intercept the convoy, Ulbricht was executed immediately behind the courtroom."

Erich Mielke has been stripped of his position and will be sent to work as a translator in the Institute of Marxism and Leninism in East Berlin.\nThe charges of being an enemy of the people and an corruptor of Marx’s teachings have passed but conspiracy and treason charges have not. It was decided that time spent reading and translating Marx’s works and the philosophies of true Marxists would aid Erich Mielke to see the true light of socialism. "

The members have all been sentenced either to death or will continue to work low-risk jobs under arrest."

These individuals are being charged with a variety of crimes including crimes against humanity, mass murder, war crimes, and many other crimes. The defendants are amongst the last of the Nazi war criminals who have yet to be tried for their crimes. The trials will be carried out in quick succession due to the large numbers of individuals on trial. Several independent reporters are claiming that the trials are not fair and being conducted too quickly with most defendants only getting a few minutes on trial. Most troubling of these reports is a 14 year old boy named Walter Jurisch who has been sentenced to 20 years. One of the prosecutors has responded by stating that they are Nazis and Nazis do not have rights.
