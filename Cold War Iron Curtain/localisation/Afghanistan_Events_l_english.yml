 AFG_Revolution.1.d:0 "Since assuming office, Prime Minister Daoud Khan, has long agitated for Pashtunistan and the liberation of Pashtuns in Afghanistan. This has garnered him popularity within the military and Kabul elite but has alienated support from the non-Pashtun population of Afghanistan. An ambitious military commander has proposed an operation to send a small number of troops into the Pakistani Tribal Areas, this will cause the heavily armed tribes there to join our forces. Together, we can then secure the Pashtunistan dream. Since 1947 the Pakistan military evacuated their forces from the Tribal Areas and their focus on the Indian border means our forces can enter with little resistance. The military commander claims the operation will be an easy maneuver that will resolve the Pashtunistan crisis decisively in our favor."
 AFG_Revolution.2.d:0 "A force of soldiers from Afghanistan recently crossed into the Tribal Areas of Pakistan in order to instigate an uprising against the Pakistani state. However, the operation ended in abject failure as local tribes loyal to Pakistan attacked the Afghans, buying time for Pakistani forces, including air power to arrive and drive off the infiltrators. This is the latest provocation by the government of Prime Minister Daoud Khan against Pakistan. Initially the Afghan government stated the attack was launched by passionate Pashtun tribesmen seeking to free their compatriots, but the Pakistan military paraded captured Afghan soldiers and documents to the media to disprove the claim. The King of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah is said to be privately infuriated by the actions of his cousin."
 AFG_Revolution.3.d:0 "The recent incursion of Afghan soldiers in the Tribal Areas along with the relentless Pashtunistan propaganda coming out of Kabul has infuriated the Pakistani government. It has decided to retaliate by initiating a blockade of land trade into Afghanistan. The vast majority of imports to Afghanistan come from Pakistani ports and this decision will likely cripple the Afghan economy unless it finds new trade routes. The announcement triggered angry Afghan protests at Pakistani diplomatic sites across the country. Prime Minister Daoud Khan called the decision an act of war and stated Afghanistan would have to look to its other neighbors for support, hinting at widening ties with the Soviets. This has caused the Americans to urge a restoration of peace in both countries as they fear the Soviets using the tension to gain a foothold in Afghanistan."
 AFG_Revolution.4.d:0 "Prime Minister Daoud Khan has recently resigned to King Zahir Shah following a tumultuous last few years in office. The deep dedication and devotion to the Pashtunistan issue by the Prime Minister made him incredibly popular among the Afghan Pashtuns. However, his failures to achieve a resolution on the matter and the Pakistani economic blockade has greatly hurt the economy. This has eroded support for the Prime Minister by the large non-Pashtun ethnic groups. With his popularity waning and the economy declining, the Prime Minister asked the King for expanded executive powers. For King Zahir Shah this was the last straw and he demanded the resignation. Soon after the resignation was announced, the Pakistan government stated it was lifted the economic blockade on Afghanistan. Despite his recent troubles, Daoud Khan remains popular and many are now accusing the King of removing the Prime Minister at the behest of Pakistan."
 AFG_Revolution.5.d:0 "King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan officially approved a new constitution for the country. The document expands democratic rights and turns the country into a parliamentary monarchy. The constitution is meant to gradually prepare Afghans for democracy. As part of its provisions, no royal family members can serve as ministers. This provision is seen as a direct attack on Daoud Khan, a cousin of the King. Despite his popularity and the new constitution effectively bars him from power. The constitution effectively creates an elected lower house of parliament that will check royal appointments. Although the document is being hailed as progressive, some observers question whether the document will simply create conflict between the parliament and council of ministers as each seeks to assert itself over the other."
 AFG_Revolution.6.d:0 "While King Zahir Shah was recovering from medical operations in Italy, his cousin, the former Prime Minister Daoud Khan seized power in a bloodless coup. The Afghan military conducted the coup, quickly seizing key government buildings and the media. Within hours Daoud Khan addressed the nation stating the years of weak government and elite collusion were over. He proclaimed Afghanistan would now be a Republic, with him as the head of state. King Zahir Khan has not responded yet and their does not appear to be any countercoup taking place. Daoud Khan has long been popular in the military for his generous funding to them as Prime Minister and his brand of nationalism has long resonated among the people, especially the large ethnic Pashtun population. With a strong base of popularity and the support of the military, Daoud Khan appears firmly in power."
 AFG_Revolution.7.d:0 "From his exile in Italy, King Zahir Khan of Afghanistan announced he would abdicate his throne and not contest the new regime in Kabul. A month ago, while the King underwent medical operations in Italy, his cousin and former Prime Minister, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup in Kabul. Daoud Khan proclaimed the country a republic and abolished the monarchy. It appears the King realized his situation had grown untenable. The military had joined Daoud Khan almost completely. In addition, there were no major public uprisings or protests against the coup indicating the people largely supported the new regime. Although it appears the King has been abandoned by the people, many are viewing his decision to abdicate as a gesture to ensure peace in the lives of his subjects. He is expected to remain in Italy for the foreseeable future."
 AFG_Revolution.8.d:0 "In stunning news from Kabul, the editor of the PDPA daily newspaper Parcham, Mir Akbar Khyber, was assassinated by a team of assassins near his home. Khyber, widely seen as the leader of the Parcham faction within the PDPA, is also deeply respected within the rival Khalq faction for his historical role as an ideologue and founder of the party. President Daoud quickly blamed Islamic militants for the attack, but many PDPA members are already pointing at the Daoud government which recently turned on its Parchamite allies. Daoud recently started to remove PDPA members from the government and has publicly stated his intention to reverse some of the socialist reforms he promised the PDPA. Although no one has claimed responsibility, rumors are everywhere, some experts posit it might have been members of Khalq hoping to force a total break between the Parchamites and Daoud. Still many Afghans are also blaming the Americans or Soviets for the attack."
 AFG_Revolution.9.d:0 "The funeral of prominent PDPA leader and Afghan communist ideologue Mir Akbar Khyber saw over fifteen thousand PDPA members march onto the streets of Kabul. Khyber, the editor of a prominent leftist newspaper, was recently assassinated near his home by unknown assailants. Although President Daoud condemned the attack and blamed Islamic militants, the angry PDPA mourners chanted anti-government and anti-American slogans. Many believe it was the government working with the Americans who killed Khyber. Prominent PDPA members speaking at the funeral echoed these sentiments which fueled the angry chanting. The funeral demonstrated to President Daoud the power of the PDPA and its infiltration of the military meant soldiers could not be deployed. President Daoud must either purge the PDPA, arrest its main leaders who addressed the funeral, or re-invite the Parchamites to the government and initiate a very gradual socialist transformation for Afghanistan." 

 AFG_War.1.d:0 "Days after the funeral of Mir Akbar Khyber, the government launched crackdown on the PDPA and many prominent PDPA leaders were imprisoned. However, instead of breaking the PDPA, the actions pushed the Parcham and Khalq factions to work together. Hafizullah Amin, a Khalq leader and the most prominent PDPA member not imprisoned, organized supporters in the government and military. When the Daoud government arrested senior leader Nur Muhammad Taraki, this led the military to take immediate action. PDPA supporters within the military led tanks and troops to seize the Defense Ministry and Presidential Palace. President Daoud refused to surrender and heavy street fighting took place as his Presidential Guard fought back. However, once pro-PDPA pilots killed their commander and flew fighter planes to bomb the loyalists, resistance quickly crumbled. President Daoud, his family, and loyal officials were all killed and soon after the Afghan military announced the end of monarchial rule in Afghanistan."
 AFG_War.2.d:0 "Within days of the military taking over the country, it announced the handover of power to the PDPA controlled Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Nur Muhammad Taraki was elected President and Prime Minister. Prominent leaders such as Hafizullah Amin and Babrak Karmal of the Parcham faction were given the title of Vice President. The Khalq faction within the PDPA is clearly in charge, but they are ruling with the Parcham faction as some ministries were given to its members. The new government quickly proclaimed its devotion to Islam, belief in democracy, and claimed a policy of positive neutrality with its neighbors. Considering the number of communists within the party, the bloodiness of the coup and purges of PDPA opponents, many observers question the sincerity of these stated beliefs. However, experts in the West believe Taraki represents a nationalist government as opposed to communist and are willing to wait and see."
 AFG_War.3.d:0 "The brief alliance between the Khalqists and Parchamites within the PDPA recently ended. The Afghan President, Nur Muhammad Taraki ordered the mass arrest and purges of Parcham members within the government and military. Parcham leader Barbrak Karmal is staying abroad. It appears President Taraki acted under pressure from his colleagues from the Khalq faction who saw the Parchamites as unwilling to take the radical revolutionary steps needed for the country. In order to ensure a successful revolution, they argued the Parcham must be removed. The mass arrests and rumored executions are said to be angering the military and leading to a deeper polarization within units. Soviet efforts to reconcile both factions in recent weeks obviously failed and Moscow is said to be upset with Taraki over his purge."
 AFG_War.4.d:0 "The Afghan government under President Nur Muhammad Taraki announced an aggressive land redistribution campaign meant to break the big landlords and provide peasants their own lands. However, after six months, the government quietly ended this program as it proved a failure. The government had announced a limit on the amount of land one could own, extra lands were to be redistributed to peasants with no compensation to previous owners. The rapidity of the reform combined with a lack of surveys and planning saw landowners use loopholes to keep their profitable lands and many peasant families take over lands of poor agricultural value. The number of crops harvested plummeted and many peasants are living on lands that cannot sustain even their families. Although the government publicly claimed the campaign was a success, many Afghan peasants are infuriated and more impoverished due to the government policy."
 AFG_War.5.d:0 "Several months ago, as part of a campaign to enlighten Afghanistan and advance the social development of the people, Afghan President Nur Muhammad Taraki initiated several reforms regarding marriage. Specifically, the practice of bride purchasing has been forbidden. This reform has provoked an angry backlash, especially among the traditional, rural population of Afghanistan. They believe all the practices are part of Afghan customs and Islam. The government is accused of targeting Afghan culture and religion. Analysts blame the backlash on the drastic nature of the reforms and a refusal of the PDPA to work with rural and religious leaders before announcing them. Muslim scholars in Kabul note the reforms, especially the ban on bride purchasing could easily be religiously justified, as Islam forbid the practice, but the government ignored involving them and are now accused of being anti-religion."
 AFG_War.6.d:0 "The continuous purges since the Saur Revolution eroded military support for President Nur Muhammad Taraki. The rapid attempt of his regime to transform Afghanistan into a modern socialist state alienated the countryside to the point that armed rebels roam across the provinces. In Herat, the arrest and brutal interrogation of several senior officers provoked their men into staging a mutiny. When other units were sent to quell the mutiny, they joined in. Soon the local rebels joined the mutinous soldiers and seized Herat. Soviet military advisors and their families present in the city were massacred. With Soviet aid, the government response was coordinated by Vice President Hafizullah Amin who sent a large military force. After heavy fighting, which included extensive government airstrikes on the rebels, the city was retaken. Although most of the mutineers and rebels were killed, a large number managed to escape and are already joining other rebel forces in the countryside."
 AFG_War.7.d:0 "The Afghan government of President Nur Muhammad Taraki took a major blow when it lost control of Herat to rebels. The city was lost after several army units mutinied, joined local rebels, and killed government loyalists. In the process, Soviet advisors and their families were also slaughtered by the rebels. Our advisors in Kabul helped the government response and we ensured the rebels were properly dealt with when the government forces retook the city. However, this incident indicates the situation in Afghanistan is growing increasingly chaotic. Although President Taraki is devoted to transforming his country along socialist lines, he is moving far too rapidly for the people. In addition, he has proven to be paranoid and his purges are narrowing his own base of support. We will have to watch the situation closely as we have invested heavily in the country and cannot afford to see one weak ruler destroy all we and the Afghan people hope to achieve."
 AFG_War.8.d:0 "Following the disaster in Herat, Afghan President Nur Muhammad Taraki was pushed to appoint Hafizullah Amin as Prime Minister. The rising star of Amin has caused a division within the ruling Khalqists faction of the PDPA. Amin has been consolidating his own base of support within the military and his elevation to Prime Minister indicates the power struggle is not going in the favor of President Taraki. This has made the Soviets concerned as Amin appears more independent than Takari by making overtures to Washington and questioning Soviet influence over Kabul. More significantly, he has resisted attempts by the Soviets to mediate between himself and Taraki. The Soviets fear their rivalry for power only weakens the regime. Much to the chagrin of the Soviets, during a recent international trip by President Taraki, Hafizullah Amin managed to remove four of his loyalists from the military, escalating tensions between both men."
 AFG_War.9.d:0 "The conflict within the ruling Khalq faction of the PDPA between President Nur Muhammad Taraki and Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin ended today. Tensions recently escalated following a Central Committee meeting in which the President proposed a new coalition government be established with the Parchamites to reunite the PDPA. Taraki was carrying out the recommendations of Moscow but Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin opposed these suggestions, rallied his supporters and blocked the President. This infuriated Taraki and the Soviets. The President then tried to remove Amin from office by posting him abroad as an ambassador, Amin refused. Finally, Taraki invited Amin to the Presidential Palace to resolve the crisis. A suspicious Amin mobilized his military allies and upon arriving, he and his supporters were fired upon. Amin escaped in his car and the military quickly acted by detaining Taraki and his allies in the Khalq faction."
 AFG_War.10.d:0 "With President Nur Muhammad Taraki removed from power, Hafizullah Amin quickly took the position of President. His ascension to power was quickly confirmed within Afghanistan and by the Soviets who urged him to slow the pace of socialist transformation and expand his base of support by unifying the PDPA. Instead, President Amin annoyed Moscow by asking they replace their ambassador to Kabul. He also expanded the purges, further crippling the Afghan government and military, this time targeting Taraki supporters. Defections and unrest have only increased. Amin refuses to slow reforms and will not open talks with the Parcham faction or the Taraki loyalists within the PDPA party. On top of all this, his government recently announced the death of former President Taraki from illness, though most accounts suggest he was strangled to death on the orders of Amin, ending any hope of a reconciliation."
 AFG_War.11.d:0 "The Soviet government and PDPA party leaders feared the purges and radical reforms of former President Nur Muhammad Taraki were pushing Afghanis too hard, however, hopes that his successor, President Hafizullah Amin would slow the deterioration has evaporated. Instead of reaching out to the Parcham faction or trying to reconcile with supporters of former President Taraki, Amin has instead intensified the scope and violence of his purge against both groups. His execution of Taraki not only intensified PDPA divisions but infuriated the Soviets who desperately wanted a reconciliation. Outside the messy power struggles, the countryside appears to be almost completely lost to the government. The military is largely crippled due to the purges and politicization of its officers. In addition, many soldiers are defecting to the rebels bringing them weapons, modern tactics, and intelligence. Many PDPA leaders in Kabul are begging the Soviets for help in preventing the collapse of the government."
 AFG_War.12.d:0 "The reports from Afghanistan are incredibly troubling. The military largely ceases to function as President Hafizullah Amin oversees a campaign of mass bloodletting against rival leftists. All this has allowed hostile states to fund and direct rebels who now run almost the entire countryside. We have invested heavily in Afghanistan and nurtured a devoted cadre of Afghan communists waiting for proper leadership. We recently received a proposal from the more moderate Parcham faction of the PDPA. They suggest we help the people of Afghanistan remove Amin and his violent cabal from power and bring the Parchamites in. The Parchamites claim they will end the infighting, establish a coalition government, and restore the trust of the people with the government. The decision is ours now, should we deploy Soviet military forces to remove Amin and save socialism in Afghanistan, or allow it to collapse and risk a new anti-Soviet regime on our border."
 AFG_War.13.d:0 "After careful planning, we launched the operation to secure Afghanistan and remove the tyrant Hafizullah Amin. The Afghan military has greatly deteriorated due to the rise of rebels and the waves of purges launched by the Amin regime. Our advisors within these units successfully locked up weapons, put heavy weaponry in maintenance, and insured important officers were at parties the night of our intervention. In Kabul, we successfully airlifted elite airborne troops who quickly moved to secure key buildings and the airport. President Amin was hosting a lavish party at the Tajbeg Palace outside Kabul. A special forces and KGB strike team led the assault, successfully overpowering the Presidential Guard and ending the life of the cruel tyrant. As this occurred, two divisions of our troops crossed the border and rapidly began occupying major towns and cities. We faced no resistance and no doubt the Afghan military happily welcome our help."
 AFG_War.14.d:0 "With Afghanistan secured by Soviet troops, Babrak Karmal quickly appeared in Kabul and was proclaimed the new President of Afghanistan. Although President Karmal claimed he had been in the country for months secretly working against the tyrannical regime of President Amin, most observers believe Moscow flew him in once their forces secured Kabul. President Karmal thanked the Soviets for accepting the invitation of the Afghan government and people to help them in their difficult time. He has already promised the release of political prisoners and a general amnesty. In addition, he promised to establish democratic institutions, and hold elections soon. His announcement is being praised among the PDPA supporters exhausted by the years of infighting, however many Afghans are skeptical these lofty promises can be kept while Soviet troops remain. Already opponents are portraying President Karmal as an illegitimate puppet and are calling for an immediate Soviet withdrawal."
 AFG_War.15.d:0 "The Soviet government decided in a recent Central Committee Meeting the plan for withdrawal from Afghanistan. The accepted plan will see Soviet troops leave with dignity at having established friendly and stable government for the people of Afghanistan. Soviet troops have no doubt done their duty and beyond, but the time has come for the people of Afghanistan to carry the fight. The first phase will see the fighting shift from Soviet soldiers to Afghan soldiers. The next phase calls for the Afghan government to launch a policy of reconciliation and broaden its base of support by bringing in former enemies. Finally, the Soviet Union will work to grant the Afghan government international recognition and cutoff foreign aid to the Mujahideen."
 AFG_War.16.d:0 "The Soviet military confirmed its forces were no longer conducting active combat operations against rebel fighters in Afghanistan. The Soviet military added it would respond if attacked but that combat operations were now to be led by the Afghans themselves. The Afghan military will still be able to call on Soviet artillery, airpower, and logistical support for its own operations. The Soviets indicated even this support will slowly be reduced as the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan finds its footing. Analysts note the Afghan military has been notorious for its desertion rates and weakening since the Soviet intervention, but a huge influx of arms and new cash incentives are expected shortly. The Soviets hope this support will jumpstart the military."
 AFG_War.17.d:0 "The Soviet government and intelligence leaders have long concluded that President Babrak Karmal, though loyal to the Soviet Union, has used Soviet aid to solidify his hold in Kabul and he lacks an interest in bringing about national unity in Afghanistan. The Afghan intelligence chief, Mohammad Najibullah has proven to be a very efficient official. He has impressed Soviet observers and his status as a religious, rural Pashtun leader means he could appeal to most Mujahideen. Although President Karmal resisted, he did eventually agree to put Najibullah in the Secretariat and turn the intelligence department into its own ministry."
 AFG_War.18.d:0 "Recently, the Soviet Union utilized diplomatic pressure and its advisors across Kabul to influence Afghan President Babrak Karmal to accept Mohammad Najibullah takeover as General Secretary of the PDPA party. Within weeks, Najibullah claimed collective leadership had been established with him and Karmal who retained several senior posts. The Soviets are happy with this shift and urge Najibullah to slowly consolidate power to preserve the dignity of Karmal. However, within the PDPA it has become clear that Karmal retains quite a bit of influence and Najibullah is largely dependent on his control of the large, ruthless, and efficient intelligence apparatus. Whether this will lead to future conflict is currently unknown."
 AFG_War.19.d:0 "The Soviets had urged Mohammad Najibullah to slowly wean Babrak Karmal out of power out of respect for his loyalty to the Soviet Union. However, Najibullah now claims that after months of tensions, the situation is untenable. Recently, he provided evidence showing Karmal was privately and publicly undermining him and had recently claimed he would soon return as General Secretary. Najibullah also added that Karmal is largely opposed to his ideas for National Reconciliation and is using his support within the party to criticize him. This last bit of information directly hinders Soviet efforts at a successful withdrawal, and they gave permission for Najibullah to act. Several days after getting approval, during a PDPA meeting, Najibullah had the party strip Karmal of his party titles. Babrak Karmal then accepted a Soviet offer to go into exile in Moscow where he will receive funds and an apartment. Najibullah is now firmly in control."
 AFG_War.20.d:0 "Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah recently announced a policy of National Reconciliation. He stated the new constitution will limit Presidential power, be inclusive and promised PDPA membership was not a requirement to hold ministries. In his address, Najibullah made five offers. One was the immediate ceasefire of government forces who would only fight back if attacked by rebels. His second offer was to offer power-sharing with what he called counter-revolutionary forces. Third was a general amnesty to enemy fighters, while the fourth and fifth promises were guarantees that the government will respect Afghan culture and adhere to Islam. To further distance the regime from communism, he also renamed the country the Republic of Afghanistan. The new policy is being praised by the Soviets as a means to incorporate the opposition into the government ranks. However, many PDPA members are criticizing it for betraying party values and many Mujahideen groups are expected to reject it."
 AFG_War.21.d:0 "Ahmad Shah Massoud has long been a thorn to the Soviets and the Afghan government. His exploits in defending Panjshir valley and media interviews have made him a national figure. Recently Massoud held secret talks with Soviet intelligence about a ceasefire. Massoud has indicated he is willing to halt fighting as long as Soviet and government forces remain outside Panjshir and its surrounding areas. The Soviets have asked President Mohammad Najibullah to agree with this ceasefire, and if it sticks, this may pave the way for Massoud and his allies to even join the government. However, if Najibullah accepts a ceasefire and essentially gives Massoud free reign in his lands, he risks alienating the hardliners in the PDPA."
 AFG_War.22.d:0 "The ceasefire between the Afghan government and militant commander Ahmad Shah Massoud remains intact. The lull in the fighting has allowed Afghan units in the area to regroup and commanders on the ground are asking permission to launch new offensives against Massoud. These commanders, along with hardliners in in the PDPA argue the current ceasefire makes the government look weak and if Massoud decides to target withdrawing Soviet troops when the time comes it would be disastrous. On the other hand, Massoud apparently is willing to accept a cabinet position and join the government if offered. Bringing Massoud on would stabilize a part of the country and help support the National Reconciliation program, however, many PDPA leaders fear such moves will lead to end of their party and regime."
 AFG_War.23.d:0 "The Iranians are sponsoring several alleged parties of resistance fighters. However, these men are generally foreigners and are mostly engaged in banditry. They make the situation in western Afghanistan very difficult and tie down a lot of our forces. As part of the recent National Reconciliation announcement, President Najibullah has asked his ministers whether he should use Soviet contacts and ask the Iranians to accept a ceasefire between government forces and these parties. Overtime we can eventually re-incorporate these leaders into the government and strengthen the country. Many cabinet members however, express dissatisfaction with the proposal as incorporating these parties would ultimately weaken the PDPA and the future of the regime."
 AFG_War.24.d:0 "The Kabul regime through Soviet intermediaries offered a ceasefire with the Mujahideen parties operating from our territory. After a six-month period, the party leaders will be incorporated int the central government while the fighters have the choice to join the Afghan military. The proposal, if accepted, would end the fighting along our border and we would no longer be involved in the fighting in Afghanistan. However, such a deal with cut us off of a role in determining the future of Afghanistan and this may lead to an anti-Iranian regime emerging. Our options are to persuade the parties to accept the ceasefire and wash our hands of Afghanistan, or to reject the offer and continue to support the Mujahideen who continue to advance towards ultimate victory."
 AFG_War.25.d:0 "Western Afghanistan has been relatively peaceful since the Iranian based Mujahideen parties and the Afghan government came to a ceasefire agreement. Now the time has arrived for the regime of President Mohammad Najibullah to incorporate these groups to the central government or risk restarting the fighting. Although Najibullah offered several minor posts to the parties, the Iranian-backed Mujahideen have countered by demanding more positions in the government and military. Accepting their demands will dilute PDPA power and influence but will go a long way in stabilizing the country. This would be the epitome of power-sharing and although the power of the center will be weakened, it may save the Afghan nation. The Soviets are eager for us to accept but many senior PDPA officials have expressed concern that incorporating the parties risks the future destruction of the PDPA in Kabul. It maybe the better option to end negotiations, restart fighting and force them to capitulate on our terms."
 AFG_War.26.d:0 "The largest and most brutal counter-revolutionary groups come from the so-called parties based in Pakistan. These groups enjoy foreign volunteers, aid, and training from Pakistani intelligence and military. These parties are mostly religious and traditionally vehemently opposed to our government. However, per the National Reconciliation plan, President Mohammad Najibullah is considering using Soviet aid in offering these groups a ceasefire and eventual incorporation in a power-sharing government. The decision now is whether to offer the ceasefire and hopefully bring stability to southern Afghanistan and the Kabul area or decline to. Opponents of the ceasefire within the PDPA warn incorporating these parties may make a unity government unstable. In addition, adding these mostly Pashtun groups to the government and military may lead to the eventual destruction of the PDPA."
 AFG_War.27.d:0 "Soviet agents have brought a proposal for the Mujahideen groups operating from Peshawar for a ceasefire and eventual incorporation with the government. We can either push the parties to accept and abide by the ceasefire or urge them to reject it. The Foreign Ministry suggests the incorporations of these parties may work to our benefit and lead to a more friendly government in Kabul. More importantly, such a scenario could ensure an end to the Pashtunistan issue permanently. However, senior military and intelligence officials are arguing against the ceasefire. They see the offer as an indication of the Kabul regime weakening and feel if the Mujahideen we support can eventually win than that will guarantee our objectives are met."
 AFG_War.28.d:0 "The six-month ceasefire has largely held with the Pakistani parties. This has brought a period of unprecedented peace in southern Afghanistan and Kabul. In negotiations over incorporating the parties, we did offer them a small percentage of seats and some ministerial force. However, they are demanding at least forty percent of the seats and some high-profile ministries. Some officials argue we should accept and bring them into the government to show the people it was the PDPA that brought peace, such popularity would help us in future elections. Others, especially the hardliners want to reject them and restart the fighting. They fear these parties will undermine Afghan sovereignty with their pro-Pakistani stance and fear the PDPA will end up becoming a minority party if more rebel groups get incorporated. The President must decide whether to incorporate these parties or to continue the war."
 AFG_War.29.d:0 "Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Pakistan, and the Republic of Afghanistan signed a final agreement in Afghanistan to resolve the war. In the agreement, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to normalize relations and pledge non-interference. This meets the Soviet goal of legitimizing their client in Kabul. The Soviets agreed to a timetable on its withdrawal. In addition, the United States has pledged to halt support for Mujahideen groups in Afghanistan. The Soviets also are to cut off arms to the Republic of Afghanistan. Both the United States and Soviet Union have agreed to be guarantors of the agreement. Many are hailing the agreement as the beginning of peace for Afghanistan. However, observers note the Mujahideen were not allowed to participate and many are skeptical if they will honor the agreement."
 AFG_War.30.d:0 "The recently concluded Geneva Accords offers a timetable for Soviet withdrawal, the principal aim of our Afghan policy. The agreement also stipulates we halt the flow of arms to the Mujahideen. However, CIA and congressional leaders are urging us to allow the arms to continue, especially since the Pakistanis are willing to continue our operations. The Soviets for years undermined us across the world and caused the deaths of many of our citizens and allies. They argue we must continue to make them bleed for their actions. Others in the administration are urging us to follow through on our promises and bring the conflict to an end. They fear a continuation of arms may further destabilize Afghanistan and may lead to unforeseen consequences."
 AFG_War.31.d:0 "The recently concluded Geneva Accords on paper secured several of our goals in ensuring a dignified withdrawal for Afghanistan. We gave President Mohammad Najibullah and his government greater international legitimacy and secured a timetable for our withdrawal. The Americans and Pakistanis also agreed to cut funding off the Mujahideen. During the negotiations we promised Najibullah continued military aid to get him to sign. Now we must decide whether we will continue to provide military aid or not. Many of our military and intelligence advisors believe we should continue our arm Najibullah to preserve our commitments and ensure we leave behind a stable Afghanistan. They also doubt the Americans will honor their own commitments. Other advisors suggest abiding by the agreement and halting arm supplies. The Afghanistan experiment has proven too costly already and washing our hands maybe the best approach."
 AFG_War.32.d:0 "As per the Geneva Accords, our forces have begun their withdrawal of Afghanistan. As per the agreement, this is a front-loaded withdrawal. Over the two months more than half of our forces are back in Soviet territory. The final withdrawal phase is about to take place and will likely last an additional six or seven months. However, the withdrawal has not gone without incidents. Our forces have taken heavy fire at times from Mujahideen fighters. We have complained bitterly to the Americans and Pakistanis over these incidents, but they claim to have no sway over field commanders. Some in the Kremlin argue the increase in violence and deterioration of security means the Geneva Accords are being ignored and we should temporarily stop the withdrawal to force compliance. This is not a realistic option, but it was decided to give commanders permission to temporarily stop the withdrawal to pressure the enemy. In the end though, the Soviet Union will not halt the withdrawal."
 AFG_War.33.d:0 "The commander of our successful withdrawal operation was the last Soviet soldier to officially cross the Oxus and mark the end of our deployment in Afghanistan. The last withdrawal phase was completed although Mujahideen harassment continued. We did temporarily halt the withdrawal but the Mujahideen called our bluff and we had to resume. Despite these issues, we brought back our men safely and turned over bases and heavy equipment for the Republic of Afghanistan. This was the parting gift of our soldiers who completed their international duty. We hold our heads high as we leave the people of Afghanistan in a position of stability and the means to defend their way of life. Our own troops crossed the border in convoys, with smiles, and waving flags. We publicized this to local and international media to demonstrate we left on our own accord and not in disarray or defeat."
 AFG_War.34.d:0 "Surrounded by media, the last Soviet troops crossed the Oxus, marking the end of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet soldiers crossed the border with broad smiles and waving flags. Although the Soviets were conveying an image of triumphant soldiers returning home from a successful mission, reports from Afghanistan suggest these troops faced constant Mujahideen attacks. The security situation now lies in the hands of the Soviet-backed Republic of Afghanistan and it remains to be seen if they can handle the burden of fighting against the numerous Mujahideen groups and reunite a country ravaged by war. The United States welcomed the Soviet withdrawal, with many officials and congressional leaders calling it the end of a brutal foreign occupation. Many added the final liberation of Afghanistan would be the removal of the PDPA regime in Kabul. The Soviets were quick to criticize the American statements as irresponsible and open threats to the legitimate government of Afghanistan."
 AFG_PAK.24.d:0 "Today we recieved a letter from Afghanistan. In it they make a request to create an autonomous Pashtunistan area around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. After discussing about it with your cabinet, it was decided that..."
