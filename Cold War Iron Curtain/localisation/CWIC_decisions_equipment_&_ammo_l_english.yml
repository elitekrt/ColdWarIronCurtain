  tutorial.211.d:0 "Cold War Iron Curtain introduces a brand new WMD system, allowing for more complicated and strategic nuclear exchanges over the standard vanilla click every province method. There are 8 basic parts to the GUI. \n 1. The top left screen shows the nuclear powers of the world- in other words, who has armed their stockpile through the political tab policy. \n 2. The Defcon screen shows your Defcon level, and is only available to the USA, USSR, and PRC. Moving the level down will indicate a higher stage of tension.\n \n 3. The middle section of the GUI shows how many of each kind of WMD you have, from vanilla nukes to ICBMs. The Chemical Weapons list on the far right is a WIP, and the denuclearize bit- well, why would you want to do that, anyway? \n 4. Underneath the section discussed in 3 are 3 options, for a level 1, 2, or 3 strike, each offering different amounts of nukes used and different targets. Level 1 is a basic attack on enemy capitals in range. Level 2 is level 1, plus extra nukes for strategic targets, ie. large population or industrial centers. Level 3 is a full, all out, nuclear broadside, and requires one of 2 things- ICBM technology, or for the USSR or USA, missiles in Cuba or Turkey, respectively. \n 5. The big greyed out nuclear button will turn red if all requirements for launch are met, and then you get to play global thermonuclear warfare. \n 6. Underneath the big button is a list of nukes required for the strike. \n 7. To the left of that is a State target list for the strike. \n 8. To the left of that is a list of enemy countries in range of your missiles. \n\n Remember, if you experience any bugs or problems with this system, don’t hesitate to list them on steam or discord. \n\n Happy Bombing!"
