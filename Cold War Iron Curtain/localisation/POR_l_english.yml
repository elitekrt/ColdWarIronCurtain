goa.1.d:0 "The Portuguese government has recently expressed concern as they claim that multiple units of the Indian Army have been amassing along the border of Portuguese Goa. Having been under Portuguese control since 1510, the land is surrounded by the new Indian state which has already expressed interest in reclaiming the area, which has a majority Indian Hindu population. Although an attack on Goa by India would be a blatant act of aggression in the eyes of the United Nations, it’s unknown whether this will deter the Indians who have already been steadily annexing European holdings on the subcontinent. If the Indians were to launch an invasion of the holding, it is highly unlikely that the Portuguese would be able to hold against the Indian forces, and would represent a decisive step in the fall of the European empires."
goa.1.t:0 "Preparations for the Invasions of Goa"
goa.1.a:0 "Let's Get India Free of Colonizers"
goa.2.d:0 "We have received disturbing reports from the governor of Goa claiming that Indian forces are rapidly gathering on the border of our province and suggesting that a military invasion is imminent. With our overstretched colonial empire it would be hard to defend the colony, however it is imperative that we at least attempt to mount a defence as a military defeat at the hands of the Indians would be a major national humiliation and could potentially galvanize guerilla resistance in our remaining colonies. With both our armies poised to mobilise around the enclave it appears that armed conflict in Goa is now inevitable."
goa.2.t:0 "Indian Troops Moving Near the Borders of our Indian Colonies"
goa.2.a:0 "Prepare Our Troops in India"
goa.3.d:0 "After a lengthy period of mobilisation and preparation, a large force of almost 50,000 soldiers have entered the Portuguese-occupied holding of Goa in a bid to liberate the colony. Codenamed Operation Vijay, the invasion is a combined land, sea and air campaign to oust the Portuguese and establish our control over the region. Reports from Goa suggest that the Portuguese have significantly limited manpower and naval and air support, meaning that our victory is all but assured and should serve as a major morale boost amongst our people as a victory against the foreign Imperialists."

goa.3.t:0 "Invasion of Portuguese India"
goa.4.d:0 "Goa had long been a blemish to the people of India. Patriotic Indians were infuriated by the idea of European colonial enclaves existing next to a free India. At first, we had sought a diplomatic solution, but the Portuguese refused. As the anti-colonial tensions ratcheted up and Portuguese refusals continued, the government directed the Indian military to plan a military solution. Soon after, Operation Vijay was launched with the intention of liberating Goa from nearly 500 years of Portuguese colonialism. The Indian military showcased its modern training and military strength by evicting a European power from its territory. The people of Goa supported the troops as they advanced, and the victory resulted in a feeling of mass euphoria across India. The operation demonstrates the Indian state has the capacity to swiftly resolve regional disputes through military options, which will no doubt make states more willing to negotiate with us in the future."

goa.5.d:0 "Goa had long been a blemish to the people of India. Patriotic Indians were infuriated by the idea of European colonial enclaves existing next to a free India. After exhausting all options the government decided on a military solution. Eventually, Operation Vijay was launched. Despite possessing the advantage of surrounding Goa and Portugal being miles away, the operation ultimately failed. Never since the Battle of Plassey had an independent Indian power suffered such a stunning defeat to a European power. Our government must reassess the military. Many argue the military retains too many of its colonial era practices and structure, it lacks a national spirit. Despite having so many officers with combat experience, the military utterly failed in what appeared to be an easy task. Politically, the government looks incredibly weak and the Indian people are said to be greatly dejected. Portugal is jubilant and look forward to dictating terms, we must lick our wounds from this humiliation."

goa.6.d:0 "When news reached Lisbon of the military struggle in Goa had ended, the people jubilantly began celebrating the incredible victory. The Indian invasion presented the greatest challenge to the policy of militarily fighting decolonization. The military faced an enemy with combat experience, good training, and well-equipped. India also had the geographic advantage. Despite this daunting task, the Portuguese military, expertly led with highly motivated troops, achieved what almost every international observer thought was impossible, they have successfully defended Goa. The Portuguese leadership had been warned its refusal to negotiate would lead to disaster but the successful victory over India confirms its policies and leadership are on the right path. The position of the government has been greatly strengthened as the people and indeed the world now sees Portugal as a tenacious power. Militarily, valuable experience and more importantly, confidence has been achieved. Now Portugal can successfully dictate to India and preserve Goa."

goa.7.t:0 "We Lost Against the Indian Invaders"
goa.7.d:0 "The defense of Goa was always going to be a difficult task. The territory was surrounded by India and the population hostile to our presence. The failure of the UN to hold India accountable before the conflict or even in its aftermath has demonstrated the global double standard that exists. Despite facing daunting odds, the garrison did their duty and resisted as best as they could. Today the government was informed our forces had surrendered after facing overwhelming military force. Although our European allies and the United States offered condemnations since the conflict began, it is clear their reaction will not go beyond diplomatic protests, which emphasizes our international isolation in terms of decolonization policy. The people of Lisbon understood the task to be very difficult but are still expected to be quite dejected as the news sinks in."

goa.8.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]India Wins War Against Portugal"
goa.8.d:0 "450 years of Portuguese colonial presence in India formally ended. The independence of India sparked the rise of nationalism among Indians in the Portuguese colony Goa. This resulted in constant protests and strikes. The Indian government long sought to discuss the Goa situation with the Portuguese, but they refused. During recent unrest in Goa, the Indian government built up a sizeable military force around the colony and ordered it to secure the colony. After a brief military struggle, the much smaller Portuguese garrison capitulated. Portugal tried to call on its international allies and the United Nations for help but could not garner support, no one appeared willing to back the return of seemingly liberated colonies. In Portugal the mood is gloom and the Indian action is considered illegal and unwarranted. Across India, there is a feeling of pride and joy for the successful eviction of another colonial power from the subcontinent and the military prowess of the Indian Army."

goa.9.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Portugal Wins War Against India"
goa.9.d:0 "The tiny nation of Portugal defied the analysis of virtually all observers and successfully defended Goa from an invasion by India. The Indian Army, despite possessing advantages in all categories, more importantly in geographic location, could not successfully marshal these into a successful intervention. For months tensions had increased as pro-Indian residents in Goa were increasingly vocal about wanting to join India. The Indian Army launched Operation Vijay (Victory) to firmly resolve the issue but were stunned by the ferocious Portuguese response. The success of Portugal has emboldened the government as the people of Lisbon celebrate their victory over an Indian goliath. While in New Delhi the government faces angry speeches by the opposition and across the country, government officials along with military personnel are said to be facing verbal abuse at the humiliating defeat."

macau.1.d:0 "The police reported that local Red Guards have assembled and launched a violent riot in the Macau. Many Chinese residents are said to be getting whipped up and actively joining the increasingly unruly crowd. The rioters are motivated by the recent unrest caused by our refusal to allow local Chinese leftists to construct a private school. It appears our hardline with arresting and breaking up the school protesters instigated this larger unrest. The local military commander promised order can be restored and the governor agrees, martial law will soon be declared, and troops will be deployed to nip this unrest in the bud through a strong show of force."

macau.2.d:0 "Following the 1-2-3 Riots in Macau, the Chinese residents grew infuriated by the harsh methods and casualties from the Portuguese military response. The Chinese launched a three nos policy, no taxes, no services, and no selling to the Portuguese until they open talks with their leaders connected with the mainland Chinese government. This campaign has gained widespread support among the Chinese residents in Macau. The economic and social impact of this campaign greatly impacts the Portuguese efforts to restore normalcy in Macau. Many in the colonial administration argue holding talks with the mainland Chinese representative in Macau is the best way forward. Conceding to this demand from the protestors may help us restore order and secure an administrative role for the territory. Others disagree, they believe that by giving in to the rioters it will only embolden their position."

From Lisbon we put pressure on our officials in Macau to be conciliatory and resolve the situation immediately. After fruitful discussions a final agreement was reached. We agreed to issue a public apology, promise to never use armed force against the Chinese community, and give them a larger role in administration. The rioters have agreed to stand down and the crisis will finally pass. Macau remains Portuguese but we have essentially ceded administrative power to the Chinese."

macau.4.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Riots in Macau"
macau.4.d:0 "Several weeks ago, residents working with local leftist organizations started construction on a private school in Macau. However, a failure to allegedly pay bribes to Portuguese officials led these to the halting of construction. Clashes immediately began with the residents and police, leading to injuries and arrests. Yesterday, at around 1 pm, the local Red Guards, inspired by the Cultural Revolution and anti-colonial fervor, began a violent riot across Macau. The rioters were joined by many Chinese residents who assaulted government buildings, tore down statues, ripped off portraits of colonial officials, and set fire to government documents. The violence caused the Portuguese authorities to declare martial law and the military intervened. In the ensuing violence, reports indicate at least eight protesters are dead with several hundred wounded. The number of those arrested is unknown but thought to be very high."

macau.5.d:0 "Our refusal to hold talks and continued use of armed force to keep protestors off the street provoked a dramatic reaction from Beijing. The Chinese government directed the Peoples Liberation Army to invade Macau and end our presence. Due to our status as a colonial occupier and violent response, it appears the chances of an international reaction or Western military response will be low. The PLA will likely swarm our garrison and use their allies among the population. Regardless, we will fight till the end for the honor of the nation. We are arranging church services across the country to offer prayers for our brave forces."

macau.6.d:0 "The riots in Macau, exacerbated by the involvement of the Red Guards, led to the destruction of Portuguese businesses, government buildings, and public symbols of colonial rule. The rioters tore down statues of Jorge Alvares and Colonel Vicente Nicolau de Mesquita. Fires burned books and government documents while government buildings were ransacked. The administration of martial law saw the Portuguese garrison deploy its forces to restore order and aid the police efforts. With fears the riots could continue, the government held talks with the Chinese community and made an agreement in which Portugal retained possession of Macau but essentially ceded administration to the Chinese community. Critics note the Chinese community is deeply infiltrated by the mainland communist government, so the agreement is a major victory for them."
macau.6.a:0 "Some good news finally"
macau.7.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]People's Liberation Army Invades Macau"
macau.7.d:0 "The Portuguese decision to take a hardline with Chinese protesters in Macau appeared to backfire in spectacular fashion. Soon after brutally putting down protests and refusing to hold talks, Beijing deployed its military forces to intervene. The PRC noted despite the riots and the successful non-cooperation campaign by Chinese residents, the Portuguese still refused to provide justice for the people of Macau. To resolve the situation and end the intolerable conditions for the people, China will resolve the situation. Experts suggest China calculated the chances of a wider Western military response will be limited due to the pattern of unrest and repression the Portuguese have already engaged in. The Portuguese garrison will face a very difficult task to withstand a PLA assault and many are not confident they possess the capability to reinforce its forces. Reaction from Lisbon has been mute as it appears it did not foresee this scenario."

He played a major role in the the military coup of 1926 and after leading a countercoup took the post of President. He immediately granted himself dictatorial powers and was formally elected President in 1928. He soon appointed Antonio Salazar as Prime Minister and by 1932 largely left the governing of Portugal to his charismatic protégé. Although the 1933 constitution established the Estado Novo and confirmed his dictatorial powers, though Carmosa rarely utilized them and let the Prime Minister govern. His most potent power was the ability to dismiss the Prime Minister, and the government will be careful at who they chose to replace him. Many in Portugal will mourn the passing of a man seen as a stabilizing force. However, his opponents will be happy to see the end of a man who brought autocratic rule to the nation."

Many across Portugal are shocked by this development. Salazar held power since 1932 and is viewed as almost an institution by the people. The resignation appears to be the consequence of a recent incident in which Salazar fell and severely hurt himself. There are rumors his days may be numbered and he may not have been lucid enough to make his own resignation.

Although he was expected to die shortly after his injury and was replaced as Prime Minister, he remained alive for two more years and reportedly even regained lucidity towards the end of his life. Salazar ruled Portugal since 1932 and has remained a divisive figure. While his supporters praise his dedication to his country and the positive outcomes of his rule, his opponents rally against the censorship and authoritarian rule of his Estado Novo regime. Regardless, Salazar was one of the most influential figures in Portuguese history, and without him holding up the Estado Novo, Portugal’s future has been thrown into uncertainty."

AJAX.910.d:0 "With the Shah facing increasingly dangerous opposition from liberals and nationalists, he hoped to rely on the clergy, a traditional source of support for the monarchy. However, his hopes were misplaced as the leading Iranian clerics instead joined the protestors in condemning the Shah. They accuse him of betraying the Islamic traditions of Iran and undermining its cultural identity. They were also quick to note that the Shah and his father were both equally guilty of degrading Islam and as such lacked any true legitimacy. It appears the clerics are still angry at the humiliation they suffered when Reza Shah used military force in Qom to bring the clerics in line to his modernization efforts, and now the clerics will have revenge on the son. The condemnation from the clerics are expected to bolster the opposition who will be joined by religious communities and organizations."
French_PM.7.d:0 "The conservative government of Antoine Pinay ended as his ministerial coalition broke up. Pinay, who narrowly avoided being declared a collaborator for his wartime support of Petain was able to organize support from conservatives in the National Assembly. He spent his brief term focused on restoring the finances of the country, but one again the lack of clear majorities in the National Assembly made his government vulnerable from the outset. Some Frenchmen now wonder what exactly has changed from the Third to the Fourth Republic."
French_PM.8.d:0 "Prime Minister René Mayer announced the end of his government after a brief stint in power. René Mayer, a member of the Radical Party, like many of his predecessors, was hindered by the lack of a clear majority in the National Assembly. The fall of his government is another sign for French citizens that the Fourth Republic may not have resolved the problems that plagued French politics before the war. René Mayer is significant for being the second Prime Minister of Jewish heritage."
French_PM.5.d:0 "For a second time, Prime Minister René Pleven announced the end of his government after another brief stint as Prime Minister. Pleven did lean towards the right however, he always struggled to maintain its support or the left due to his strong commitment towards European integration. Like in his previous government, he soon found himself battling both the left and right, leaving his coalition vulnerable. Eventually his wobbly ministerial group could not be maintained, and his government had to end."
