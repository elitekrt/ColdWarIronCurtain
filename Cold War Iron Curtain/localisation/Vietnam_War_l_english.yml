 NLF_Flavor.1.d:0 "For the communists in South Vietnam the Saigon government has failed to hold unification elections and has continued a policy of oppression against the communists. The regular bouts of political infighting in Saigon along with corruption has greatly alienated the peasants and villages located away from the cities. Recently, the North Vietnam government approved a liberation war for the South Vietnamese communists. Viet Minh cadres who stayed behind after the French withdrawal were activated. Many are now training peasants in guerrilla warfare and instructing in in communist doctrine. Others are already launching attacks on government officials in the countryside with the hopes of quickly liberating South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese government are deploying its own forces and has pledged to quickly deal with the unrest."
 NLF_Flavor.2.d:0 "After the Geneva Accord, the communists and Viet Minh decided to form the National Liberation Front (NLF) to carry out the communist cause in South Vietnam. Although the Accord stipulated all Viet Minh must withdraw from the south, several thousand will be secretly left back to makeup the core of the NLF. For the moment the NLF will stay low profile, make contacts amongst the peasants and spread communist ideology among them. The NLF will also sow unrest and instability to keep the Saigon government weak. The NLF plans to setup several front organizations, including religious movements to cover their involvement and strike at Saigon from different angles. The NLF will be the vanguard of the southern revolution and lead the unification of Vietnam when the moment arrives."
 Vietnam_War_Decisions_category_desc:0 "The failure for North Vietnam and South Vietnam to agree on a unification plan left the regional situation perilous. Among the South Vietnamese there were those hoping a viable government could emerge but in rural areas, there was rising discontent over political uncertainty and corruption. The North Vietnamese decided to take advantage and began training South Vietnamese communists to begin a national struggle for unification. North Vietnamese cadres are also being infiltrated to aid their allies in the south. The South Vietnamese government is organizing its own forces and supporters to crush this threat and then liberate Vietnam themselves.\n\nNational Liberation Front Funding [?NLF.global_nlf_funding]\nRepublic of Vietnam Funding [?VIE.global_vie_funding]"

 VIN_Bao_Dai.1.d:0 "Today we have made the decision to denounce Bao Dai. The final emperor of the Nguyen dynasty has shown his incompetence for the last time. He is simply a French puppet and does not care for his people! He does not even have the self determination to even spend time in our land, and would rather spend time with the imperialists in France. He is a symbol of the oppression that has plagued our nation for too long."
 CPSU_VIN.1.d:0 "The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union takes place today. We have received information about a secret speech that is denouncing the former leader of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin and his personality cult. It talks about how he consolidated power and established a cult like worship for him and the power he held. The CPSU has been a victim of his actions and we endorse First Secretary Khrushchev’s speech, communism is an ideology to support all, not just the elite at the top of hierarchy we have tried so hard to abolish. While we might be a little uncertain about the speech, we will support our comrades in the north. Hopefully the rest of their nation will come to understand the true motives of the former leader."
 Le_Duan.1.d:0 "Le Duan has been cranking his revolutionary campaign into absolute overdrive. He has criticized the current leadership for their lack of initiative in allowing the death of our comrades in the traitorous state to the south. Diem has been doing nothing but giving in to capitalists and imperialists, he is allowing the American government to use him as a puppet to expand their influence in Indochina and the rest of Southeast Asia. He has reorganized combatants after the Geneva Accords and calls for our military to act to assist southern fighters. According to Le Duan, the common task of the Vietnamese revolution at present is to accelerate the socialist revolution in North Vietnam whilst at the same time stepping up the National People's Democratic Revolution in South Vietnam."
 VIN_Geneva.1.d:0 "We have received a rather strange offer from our neighbour in the north that is asking for a referendum. During the Geneva Accords it was stated that there is supposed to be a referendum held for unification to solve the split, but we are receiving pressure from the elite in our government and the American government to refuse to sign it. We don’t really have a choice in this matter.. do we?"
 VIN_Geneva.2.d:0 "To nobody's surprise the south has rejected our offer for a referendum despite that being stipulated in the Geneva Accords. It is clear that South Vietnam will not cooperate with us and is under the influence of the American government even though we have the support of the Chinese and the French. We hope that maybe in due time our comrades in the south will understand who is the rightful owner of the disputed lands."
 VWP.1.d:0 "The Fifteenth Plenum of the Vietnamese Workers Party is taking place and a choice now has to be made in choosing a new group to be in power. We have a choice between Le Duan and his southern faction which seek to start a conflict to unite the South and North, the Maoist group that seek to introduce more intense land reform as seen in China led by Truong Chinh, or we can choose to keep the faction led by Ho Chi Minh who has been feeling rather under the weather in these last few weeks. Keeping Ho Chi Minh in power also involves giving more power to the great General Vo Nguyen Giap."

 Vietnam_America.1.d:0 "\nDue to rising tensions in North Vietnam and overall disagreements about internal policy, the North Vietnamese government has announced the closure of the American consulate in the nation and have given all staff there sufficient time to leave. North Vietnam has come out and spoken over the injustice of the United States, their injustice and covert actions, as well as their support for South Vietnam and have decided that enough is enough. All the eyes in the world are now focused on this little part of the world... all the wonder can wonder is what conflict will arise from this?"
