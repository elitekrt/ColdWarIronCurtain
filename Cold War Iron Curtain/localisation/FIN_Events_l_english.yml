 fin.1.d:0 "For too long the workers at Kemi Oy Pajusaari have been striking. After Ministry of Social Affairs wage department wanted to lower the salery of the woodworkers by 30-40 percent, the workers decided to strike. Soon after the workers of Kemi Harbour and Kaarihaara Saw followed, including some local woodworkers resulting in thousands of workers striking. The situation started escalating when multiple parties attempted to end the strike in their favour. The struggle was mostly between Communist Party of Finland and the Prime Minister K-A Fagerholm's cabinet. The cabinet controlled a large part of the trade unions through the Social Democratic Party and the communists wanted to regain the power their parliamentary organization Finnish People's Democratic League had lost in the 1948 legislative election. Even the Soviets tried interfering, with the Soviet ambassador Grigori Savonenkov who voiced his support for the striking workers.\nAs the strikes went on, the government declared the strikes illegal. The strike caused a jam of 20,5 million cubic foot of logs to the mouth of Kemijoki river. The employers recruited strikebreakers, bringing them to work under police protection.\nAs the strikers went on a peaceful march of more the 3,000 strikers went on their way to the estuary, where the strikebreakers were driving logs and releasing the jam. As the march was stopped by armed policemen, a violent riot burst out. Protesters were equipped with sticks and rocks, while the police were using their batons and guns. One striker was shot and a female worker was fatally hit by a truck. It is still unclear who fired the deadly shot. According to official forensic examination the bullet was not shot from any of the police guns. One police officer stated he was prevented from shooting at a violent striker only by his gun jamming.\nAs a result, president Juho Kusti Paasikivi called a general alert of the armed forces and the government sent army troops to Kemi. This ended up with an arrest of 22 leading activists. A total number of 127 strikers were later accused of uprising, 63 of them were sent to prison. The police violence caused a series of sympathy strikes around Finland by communist dominated trade unions like the seamen's union led by Niilo Wälläri and a large number of metal workers.\nFinnish government was even afraid of communist uprising and Soviet intervention. Communists in turn, were accusing the government for violating the Paris Peace Treaty since they had sent military against the striking workers. The American press characterized the incident as a \"test for Finnish democracy\". Soviet newspaper Pravda was talking about \"police terror\" and "Prime Minister Fagerholm's collaboration with American imperialists". The sympathy strikes were finally put down several weeks later, as the Social Democrat controlled Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions expelled the striking unions. Several other unions decided to cancel their planned strikes. Some trade union leaders were later put on trial and given short sentences."

The job was given to a work group called Matematiikkakonekomitea, known in english as Mathematics Machine Committee lead by Erkki Laurila.\n\nThey started working on a first Finnish build computer based off a prototype German G1a computer. However the project faced many problems, including errors in the blueprints, inability to modify it due to it being a pre-made design and the fact that the G1a was already outdated. The computer, named ESKO, short for Elektroninen SarjaKOmputattori was eventually finished in 1960.\n\nThe first computer in Finland however was a IBM 650 nicknamed ENSI ordered by Postisäästöpankki in 1958."

Juho Kusti Paasikivi died of a heartattack in a early morning of winter 1956, having spent the rest of his life in relative solitude writing memoires of his life. Notably Paasikivi actively did partake in discussions with the next president Urho Kekkonen, during the final months of his life with Kekkonen looked upwards to his predecessor for help in internal- and external security matters. J.K.Paasikivi, was admitted to the hospital in November of 1956; for the account of his poor heart condition and the general tiredness that ensued, after said condition. His funeral will take place with the national honours at Helsinki Suurkirkko (later called tuomiokirkko after 1959) in 23rd of December 1956, having spent over 50 years in politics. His final resting place will be set to be Hietaniemi's burialgrounds in Helsinki. "Suuren vainajan mukana oli poistunut kappale Suomen historiaa, jota hän itse oli ollut luomassa!" (''With the great befallen has a piece of finnish history evaporated, that he was himself there to create!'') said Filmisepo's reporter at a their news broadcast. The funeral took place within a very short timespan, only month and a half before the 5th President of Finland; Risto Heikki Ryti (3.3.1889 -25.10.1956) was buried. Both burials held the same form as the burial of Presidentti Kyösti Kallio's burial, since he died in 1940. Paasikivi's death was notable to post WWII Finland also due to the fact that the Soviet Union's highest council had sent a high ranking delegation to commemorate Finland's 7th President's death."

This means using sometimes even radical measures to make sure the Soviets see Finland as a good neighbour.\n\nThe doctorine has recieved quite a bit of criticism though, ranging from the Soviets not seeing Finland as neutral, cooperation with Western intelligence agencies to some seeing the doctorine tending towards a \"liturgy\" of good relations."

The base is located only 30 kilometers (19 mi) west of Helsinki. According to the armistice of 1944, the area was leased to the Soviet Union for 50 years. On February 10, 1947, the Paris peace treaty reaffirmed the Soviet Union's right to occupy this area until 1994.\n\nDescribed by some as a dagger pointing at the Finnish capital, it would provide a remarkable advantage to the Soviets in case of a war. As a result, it would be in our best interests to drive the Soviets out of there.\nHowever, there have been rumours that they might be willing to return it back to us due to technological progress making coastal artillery obsolete, along with showing the west the peaceful relationship between our nations. Despite this, when our diplomat Eero A. Wuori asked the Soviet ambassador Viktor Lebedev about these rumours, he quickly dismissed them, stating \"Porkkala is essential to defence of Leningrad and harmless to Finland.\" This however hasen't stopped the rumours, and [FIN.GetLeader] has been advised to discuss this in the upcoming state visit."

After a brief talk about the global situation, the discussion moved towards the relations between us and Finland. Firstly it was decided that the agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (YYA) would be extended by 20 years. At some point the area of Porkkala became the subject of discussion. [FIN.GetLeader] mentioned about hearing rumours that we might be willing to return it early.\n\nIt's true that for a while now, [SOV.GetLeader], along with several generals have been considering the usefulness of the base. As technology has advanced significantly since we gained the base in 1944, the original benefit has been lost. Among other things, the base is very expensive to maintain due to its location and the need for extremly tight border security.\n\n[SOV.GetLeader] didn't deny these rumours, but wasn't willing to share the reasons due to state security. [FIN.GetLeader] then asked if we would be willing to start the negotations about returning the base back to Finland."
 fin.6.tt:0 "This means you keep the base until the end of the lease (1994). Do note however, that it is very expensive to maintain due to its location and the need for extremely tight border security. As time passes, the costs will only increase. Along with this, the personnel stationed there tend to have very little interest in their duties, preferring to get drunk and cause trouble. Some might even try to defect to Finland.\nIf thats not enough, we miss a great diplomatic opportunity to show the West our willingness to peace with our neutral neighbor. The Finnish government is unlikely to object our decision, but the Finnish people will be sour. [SOV.GetLeader], we won't stop you from doing this but please remember, we warned you.\n"

The departure of the Marshal was expected both in the close circle and among the Finnish people.\nFew days earlier, Mannerheim had fallen ill and had an emergency abdominal surgery. The surgery was successful, however his heart could no longer withstand the strains of the previous illnesses. He understood that the end was near, said goodbye to those present, and thanked them for all that they had done for him. Shortly after, he fell unconscious and died four hours later.\nAt the Canton Hospital, the body of the Marshal rested on a podium in the middle of the chapel, covered with the Finnish flag and surrounded by flowers. Around him stood Swiss police officers in the guard of honor. The next day, president [FIN.GetLeader] spoke solemnly beautifully on the radio about Mannerheim's memory and life's work. The government appointed a commission to prepare the state funeral. It was decided that the funeral would be held 2 weeks later."

We meanwhile have to ratify the agreement in the parliament and prepare to return the land to their rightful owners. Soon after his arrival, president [FIN.GetLeader] gave a radio speech, stating "For the first time, I've returned from the Soviet union satisfied.

The Soviets organised a tour of the area to Finnish and foreign journalists.\n\nThe press describes the event as \"A Victory for the Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctorine.\" Some are even thinking this as a possibility for return of Karelia. The return however has also gathered some criticism, with some criticizing Kekkonen for taking too much credit for the event. Minister Aarre Simonen downplayed the event due to the fact that the deal didn't include Karelia. President [FIN.GetLeader] scolded him harshly, ending his rant stating \"Maybe Mr. Simonen goes to Moscow himself and brings an American soldier with him.\"\n\nAs the Soviets didn't have much use for the base towards the end, many of the remaining buildings showed signs of neglect. Even worse, many graveyards had been destroyed and graves vandalised. While this was disregarded as a work of only a few drunk soldiers, they have already agreed to repair the damages and pay abundant compensations for it."

The reasons stated for the occupation of Porkkala related to the defence of Soviet sea lanes in the Gulf of Finland and the protection of Leningrad.
