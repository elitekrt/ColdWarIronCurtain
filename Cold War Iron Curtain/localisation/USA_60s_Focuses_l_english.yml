 Operation_Firebird.1.d:0 "As a part of the ongoing Korean War, Commander-in-Chief of UNCOM General Douglas MacArthur has set in motion Operation Hudson Harbor, a plan that will now live in infamy. Under cover of night, fifty B-29s took off from multiple airstrips and aircraft carriers positioned in range of the Korean-Manchurian border, all armed with a nuclear payload. One by one, they delivered their hellish payloads, decimating the border from Antung to Hunchun and effectively trapping the Chinese Red Army. The strike has been further expanded, with an escorted B-29 delivering a higher payload bomb in a brutal attack on Beijing. In a few hours, the supply and command lines of the supporting Communists have been destroyed, and the Red Armies have been disorganized. Now, the Commander-in-Chief has begun the second phase of his plan, as hundreds of thousands of American and Kuomintang soldiers land in mainland China."

 Castro.1.d:0 "The Cuban government announced an attempt to assassinate President Fidel Castro was foiled. The government stated a team of imperialist thugs and traitors to the people attempted to take the life of Castro but were caught red handed. They added that any Cubans caught abetting or aiding the assassins would also be arrested and tried. Justice would be done in the name of the Cuban people. Although details were not provided, the Cuban government also stated they believed the plot to be one by American intelligence agents. The United States did not comment on the accusations of involvement in the attempt but did state these attempts demonstrate the desire of Cubans to be free of Castro and his oppressive regime."			#Plans to Assassinate Castro	
 Castro.2.d:0 "Prior to the Cuban Revolution, American crime bosses owned casinos, hotels, and owned other valuable economic assets across Cuba. However, following the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro led a campaign to curb foreign access to Cuban assets and many American crime bosses lost millions. Today, these groups had their revenge as they used their pre-Revolution contacts to slip poison, provided by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), into the food of Castro. The Cuban leader passed away by the morning. This shocking development was well-received in Washington but across Cuba hundreds of thousands came out in grief at the death of their popular national hero. The Cuban government quickly promised retribution to anyone involved in the plot."			#Assasination of Castro

However, following the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro led a campaign to curb foreign access to Cuban assets and many American crime bosses lost millions. Today, an attempt to poison the food of Cuban leader Fidel Castro was discovered. Cuban security personnel quickly captured the group which delivered the poisoned dish to Castro and announced the plot was hatched by the American mafia. The Cuban government added the sophistication of the poison and the organization of the plan made them suspect the mafia was working closely with the American government. So far the United States has not commented on these accusations."			#Failed Assasination of Castro
 Diem_Coup.1.d:0 "South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu were brutally assassinated during a military coup launched by nationalist officers. President Diem became the first leader of South Vietnam and had a reputation for being among the leading anti-colonial and anti-communist activists in Vietnam. A deeply devoted Catholic, the Diem regime struggled in recent years to deal with communist guerrillas operating in the countryside and resistance from the majority Buddhist population. Buddhists protesting the discriminatory policies by the Diem government and were met military fire. This led many nationalists within the military and government to conclude Diem had to be removed in order to unite the nation against the communist threat. After the coup plotters in the military isolated Diem from loyalist forces, they assaulted his residence, eventually capturing Diem and his brother who attempted to flee. Despite guarantees from the generals and the United States that Diem would receive safe passage out of the country, on his transportation to the military headquarters, Diem and his brother were bayoneted and shot by a junior officer. Many in the new ruling junta condemned the act but it remains unknown if the killing was accidental or ordered by the junta to consolidate power. However, the killing may have made the situation more unstable as pro-Diem officials may now be less inclined to work with the junta against the communists, further dividing the South Vietnamese state."			#Anti-Diem Coup

 CIA.1.d:0 "Project MKUltra has recently been launched, it is a program whose purpose is to perform experiments on human subjects to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in the interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions/extract information through mind control. It's organized by the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and coordinated by the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. We examined means using chemical, biological, and radiological methods of mind control as part of MKUltra. Some of our experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts, and sex workers.

Mockingbird, the brainchild of CIA Director Allen Dulles, entails many independent actions across the United States to ensure the validity of content published in newspapers. The CIA will deliver reports conforming with American policy in the hands of cooperating journalists from the New York Times to the Washington Post. Along with containing the publishing of anti-American Propaganda, and increasing the amount of Pro-American information in the flow of newspapers, some civic agencies such as the National Student Association will be funded by the CIA"				#Operation Mockingbird
 CIA.3.d:0 "Being one of the many sub projects of MKULTRA, Operation Midnight Climax is one of the strangest our intelligence agency has ever undertaken. CIA operatives involved with Midnight Climax would hire prostitutes in San Francisco to lure clients back to brothels. Once there, the agents secretly drugged their targets and watched them engage in sexual activities from behind a two-way mirror. One of the heads of the project set up a brothel in San Francisco, he wanted the spot to have "a French-whorehouse look" he said. Hopefully the operations they conduct are conclusive and bring back many results to further the scientific data MKULTRA is trying to achieve."				#Operation Midnight Climax
 CIA.4.d:0 "Project MKNAOMI is the code name for a joint research program between the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense, launched around the same time that MKUltra was launched, it's focused on biological warfare agents, specifically being able to store materials that could either incapacitate or kill a test subject and to develop devices for the diffusion of such materials. Surveillance, testing, upgrading, and evaluation of special materials were also provided by MKNAOMI to ensure no defects and unwanted issues emerged in actual use. The U.S. Army's SOC was assigned to assist the CIA during development. One such invention was a modified firearm that fired special darts coated with biological agents and various poisonous pills. They were tested on guard dogs, allowing agents to infiltrate the area that the dogs were guarding, then would be used to awaken the dogs upon exiting the facility. "				#Operation MKNAOMI
 CIA.5.d:0 "Parent project to MKOFTEN, the CIA's MKULTRA project was renamed MKSEARCH, indicating a refined search for a more perfect truth serum. Based on some of the prior research of doctors involved in the OSS and later CIA, who had studied experiments of German psychiatrists with concentration camp prisoners, the project requires more "expendables", or test subjects. MKSEARCH tests would be carried out at CIA safe houses in cities like Washington, New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The experiments would focus on the exploitation of human weaknesses and the destabilization of the human personality. In large cities, it was suggested, finding “expendables” who would not be missed would be much easier than in smaller towns or rural areas. The subjects of the experiments would be exposed to tests designed to create disturbances of behavior, alterations of sex patterns, and stimulation of aberrations, which could all be used in the process of interrogations and the obtaining of information." #Operation MKSEARCH
 CIA.6.d:0 "Project MKOFTEN was a covert Department of Defense program developed in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency. A partner program to MKSEARCH, the goal of MKOFTEN was to "test the behavioral and toxicological effects of certain drugs on animals and humans." CIA's Operation Often, a related program was also initiated to explore the "world of black magic" and "harness the forces of darkness and challenge the concept that the inner reaches of the mind are beyond reach." As part of the operation, CIA employees visited and recruited fortune-tellers, palm readers, clairvoyants, astrologers, mediums, psychics and numerous other occult practitioners. MKOFTEN was involved in “everything from séances and witchcraft to remote viewing and exotic drugs.”				#Project MKOFTEN
 CIA.8.d:0 "Operation CHAOS or MHCHAOS was a Central Intelligence Agency domestic espionage project that targeting the American people, it was started in 1967. Our mission is to uncover possible foreign influence on domestic race, anti-war, and other protest movements. It was launched under the Director of Central Intelligence. When [USA.GetLeader] was elected in 1968, existing domestic surveillance activities were consolidated into Operation CHAOS. The project used CIA stations abroad to report on antiwar activities of American citizens traveling abroad, employing methods like physical surveillance, and electronic eavesdropping, utilizing "liaison services" in maintaining such surveillance. The operations were later expanded to include more men. In 1969, following the expansion, the operation began developing it's own network of informants for the purposes of infiltrating various foreign antiwar groups located in foreign countries that might have ties to American groups."

 CIA.9.d:0 "Project MERRIMAC was a domestic espionage operation that began in 1967. Coordinated under the Office of Security of the CIA. It involved information gathering procedures via infiltration and surveillance on Washington-based anti-war groups that might pose potential threats to the CIA. However, the type of data gathered also included general information on the infrastructure of targeted communities. Project MERRIMAC and its twin program, Project RESISTANCE were both coordinated by the CIA Office of Security. In addition, the twin projects were branch operations that relayed civilian information to their parent program, Operation CHAOS."				#
 CIA.10.d:0 "Project RESISTANCE was a domestic espionage operation coordinated under the Domestic Operations Division of the CIA. Its purpose is to collect background information on groups around the U.S. that might pose threats to CIA facilities and personnel. Starting in 1967, many local police departments, college campus staff members, and other independent informants collaborated with the CIA to keep track of student radical groups that opposed the U.S. government's foreign policies on Vietnam. Project RESISTANCE and its twin program, Project MERRIMAC were both coordinated by the CIA Office of Security. In addition, the twin projects were branch operations that relayed civilian information to their parent program, Operation CHAOS."				#Operation RESISTANCE
 Operation_Shock.1.d:0 "After the Tet Offensive took place, a small team of CIA analysts lead by George Carver, reacted to the attack by coming up with a plan they called Operation Shock. The analysts were worried that the generals in the South Vietnamese Government grew too comfortable with the American military helping them, which would lead to growing support for the Vietcong. The plan is to have the Vice President supervise a purge of all military and civilian officials guilty of corruption or other abuses of power.The team also mentioned other solutions to turn the tide of the war if this plan failed, including forcing the current President to resign and letting a war hero come into office, temporarily stopping bombardment of North Vietnam and initiate talks to try and negotiate surrender, or talks with the National Liberation Front to possibly form a coalition government.

The CIA themselves claim that air operations in Laos were among the largest paramilitary operations ever undertaken by the organization. For years, they directed native forces against North Vietnamese forces, organizing tribes to fight Laotian communists as well, they even used the airline Air America to drop millions of pounds of foodstuffs, transport thousands of troops, and conduct reconnaissance. The CIA operated with early night-vision goggles, and some state-of-the-art electronic equipment. Our efforts are superb, the use of manpower has been excellent, and we have helped the Laotian people fight the communist threat."

 Reagan.103.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has a long history of opposing civil rights laws but insists he is no segregationist. He simply supports the importance of states rights. However, he especially opposes certain provisions of the landmark Civil Rights Act and has instructed senior officials to investigate the possibilities of amending the bill to end restrictions on states. However, opponents say these amendments would remove protections for minorities, strong congressional opposition is expected to any changes. The President is also not expected to utilize executive power to facilitate the enforcement of the act, which many suggest may undermine its impact for minorities."
 Goldwater.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] announced the federal government will respect States Rights and no longer force a federal agenda on individual states. President [USA.GetLeader] emphasized that federal requirements and court orders must be implemented but stated states must be allowed to implement them on their own terms in order to ensure a stable and friendly atmosphere across the country. The announcement was met with condemnation, especially from activist and civil rights group who argue not forcing states to comply to federal directives will see them perpetuate their systems of injustice and avoid making the drastic changes necessary."
 USAUrban.1.d:0 "After a series of violent protests and unrest across American urban centers, President [USA.GetLeader] announced peace had returned to all American cities. He cited the efforts of law enforcement, along with state and federal officials in combating the unrest. When asked if he would commission an investigation into the recent unrest, the President stated that would be under consideration. Although the unrest has ended, opponents of the President suggest the unrest had simply died out or was forcibly dispersed by government efforts. National Guards units called up or put on alert across the country are expected to stand down."
 Bussing.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] directed cabinet members and senior officials to direct federal officials to withdraw pressure and funds for states to implement desegregation bussing programs. Bussing programs place and move students to different schools in order to combat segregation and end inequalities between schools based on racial lines. President [USA.GetLeader] stated while he did not oppose the purpose of bussing, he wished to respect the rights of states and local parents. He stated the federal government had no business to interfere so directly in the affairs of state and local education policy."
 Goldwater.201.d:0 "Across the nation, this morning FBI and local law enforcement officers raided party offices connected to prominent black nationalist organizations. President [USA.GetLeader] addressed the media that afternoon to announce he was directing federal agencies to crackdown on militant black nationalism. The President stated these organizations were engaged in militant activities, arms training, and illegal activities including organized crime. He stated the government feared such groups may soon engage in overt violence against non-blacks and the government. He stated the raids this morning were just the beginning and the campaign would intensify in the upcoming months."
 Goldwater.202.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] stated his government would issue an executive order to preserve the principle of states rights. The new order would guarantee states their rights and prohibit the federal government from using force, intimidation, or funding pressure to force states to comply to directives. The announcement was received warmly by southerners opposed to recent federal legal rulings regarding segregation, but in college campuses across the country, protests broke out. In addition, several prominent members of congress stated the President was desecrating the Civil War sacrifices of Union soldiers and citizens."
 Goldwater.200.d:0 "Americans watching the news last night were stunned to see police and national guardsmen brutally breaking up anti-war protests being held on several major university campuses. This follows President [USA.GetLeader] earlier statement that anti-war protestors undermined the United States and aided her enemies abroad. He called the threat immense and stated the government would begin cracking down on such organizations. In addition to the violent breakup of demonstrations, the FBI has raided prominent anti-war organization, seizing thousands of documents. An FBI spokesman stated they expect to prosecute many anti-war leaders for foreign ties and violent communist sympathies."
 Klan.1.d:0 "The recent revival of the infamous Ku Klux Klan and several high-profile incidents of violence against African Americans pushed President [USA.GetLeader] to announce the Attorney General would soon announce charges against Klan leaders involved in the violence. The President stated Klan violence had no place in modern America and declared the government would not stop prosecuting the group until it stopped its violence against American citizens. Many minority communities across the country will welcome the news, though how the Klan will react is unknown as it has a decentralized structure."
 ERA.1.d:0 "The campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was first introduced in 1923. The amendment seeks to end any legal discrimination between the sexes. The changing social and cultural life has revived efforts to pass the ERA. Thousands of women have participated in protests or signed petitions urging Congress to finally approve ERA. Women still face legal hurdles in cases related to divorce and other important issues. College and middle-class women are behind the ERA resurgence, but working-class women oppose ERA, fearing the bill would end labor protection laws passed for preserving women rights at the workplace."
 JFK_Mafia.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader], working closely with the Attorney General, has directed the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the IRS to begin investigations and closely collaborate on cases targeting organized crime in the United States. The President noted that organized crime had flourished due to federal law enforcement focusing on more overt crimes. Although these investigations may take many years to complete, President [USA.GetLeader] hopes cities like Las Vegas and Newport Kentucky will be rid of organized criminal elements. However, this new initiative will no doubt infuriate powerful criminal families and there some concerns within the government of retaliation."
 LBJ_Civil.1.d:0 "After the passing of the Civil Rights Act by President [USA.GetLeader] questions were raised on how to enforce the new law. Many southern communities, including state officials resisted implementing the law. To combat this, the President has decided to launch injunctions, federal prosecutions, and has dispatched officials to trouble spots in order to achieve compliance. The President is also considering signing executive orders to empower federal agencies to make sure the Civil Rights Act gets implemented. However, this approach has alienated some members of Congress who fear a federal overreach may embolden opponents to civil rights."
 Nixon.1960.d:0 "The Dixiecrats emerged as segregationist, dissenting faction in the Democratic Party that ended their dissent in 1948. However, they remained upset with the civil rights situation and the recent Presidential election indicates the southern democrats maybe shifting allegiance. Several traditionally Democratic southern states fall to the Republican candidate. These results have enraged Democratic Party leaders who blamed the Dixiecrat influence and the southern Democrat focus on segregation as turning the south towards the Republicans. Whether the Democrats can resolve this division is unknown, but the Republicans are expected to try and push southern Democrats to join them."
 Nixon_native.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] laid out his vision for the relationship between the United States and the many Native American communities within the country. He announced the old policy of termination or forced assimilation would be ended in favor of self-determination. The President emphasized Native Americans must make their own choices and decisions. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will dispatch federal funds to recognized tribes to distribute on their terms. Although many tribes have applauded the effort, non-reservation, urban Native Americans have voiced concern that they will be excluded from such resources or at the mercy of elders."
 Rockefeller.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has long discussed his concern over welfare spending by the government. The President felt uncontrolled welfare would be detrimental to the development and social character of the country. Upon taking office, President [USA.GetLeader] met with relevant cabinet members and congressional leadership to develop a strategy to control welfare spending and institute several programs, including one which would see welfare recipients capable of working be put into job training programs. The President announced today that his efforts have borne fruit and welfare spending, once thought uncontrollable, has been stabilized."
 Rockefeller.2.d:0 "In a public ceremony, President [USA.GetLeader] officially unveiled his new art initiative. An avid art collector and patron himself, the President proudly stated his new art initiative would see the top artist in the United States not only gain vital funding for projects but also be showcased. He insisted American talent in all fields must be supported and his initiative will help demonstrate American creativity and lead to greater collaboration between the United States and the rest of the world. Although the initiative has been lauded in the press, detractors have called it a vanity project for the President."
 Desegregation.1.d:0 "Following the supreme court decision declaring segregation unconstitutional, military veteran James Meredith attempted to register as a student at the University of Mississippi (also called Ole Miss). Meredith met hostile protestors and the governor refused to protect or support the desegregation of the University. In response, President [USA.GetLeader] today directed the United States Marshals and United States Army to enforce desegregation and deploy to the campus. Meredith is expected to register under the protection of the Marshals and troops but thousands of anti-desegregation protesters are assembling, many fear violence may occur between federal troops and the furious protestors."
 Desegratation.2.d:0 "In the White House today, President [USA.GetLeader] signed Executive Order 11063. The order “…prohibits discrimination in the sale, leasing, rental, or other disposition of properties and facilities owned or operated by the federal government with federal funds.” Segregation has now been banned on all federally funded housing and is being hailed as a great victory in the civil rights movement. More significantly, many hope the order will end the decades long practice of black communities being chronically underfunded by federal funds, especially in communities with a pressing need for such housing."
 Wallace.5.d:0 "The War on Drugs is a campaign led by the U.S. government and spearheaded by President [USA.GetLeader] regarding drug prohibition, military aid, and military intervention with the aim of reducing illegal drug trade in the United States. The plan includes a set of drug policies that intend to discourage the production, distribution, and consumption of psychoactive drugs that the participating governments and the United Nations have made illegal. Some methods that have been employed against drugs include drastically increasing sentencing for anything related to it, ownership, selling, use, production, you name it, they'll book you. According to some NGOs, the War on Drugs is causing soaring arrest rates that disproportionately target African Americans due to various factors. Some say the War on Drugs is being used to criminalize and disrupt black and hippie communities and their leaders. You should always remember, drugs are public enemy number one!"   #War on Drugs
