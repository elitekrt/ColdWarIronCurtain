 congo.6.b:0 "Gizenga is right..."
 congo.7.t:0 "Simba Rebellion"

As he advanced, he eventually became the Vice Governor-General of Ruanda-Urundi, the Belgian administered League of Nation mandate. Upon taking his last post in Congo, Jungers helped oversee a more active colonial administration that became more deeply involved in the economic and social progress of Congo. Despite his background as a career colonialist, Jungers carried out the reforms as directed by Brussels. Jungers is expected to take a senior board position within a major corporation operating in Congo."
