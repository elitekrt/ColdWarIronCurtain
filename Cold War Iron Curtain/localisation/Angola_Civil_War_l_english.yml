  Angola_Civil_War.0.d:0 "Within 24 hours of signing the Alvor Agreement, the capital of Angola erupted into violence as the MPLA and FNLA started a struggle for control of the city. Many had hoped the Alvor Agreement would have resulted in a national government under the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA that would establish peace in Angola, unfortunately this did not happen. The MPLA claimed the FNLA had attempted to assassinate its leader while the FNLA claimed the MPLA had engaged in a power grab. As the fighting intensified UNITA withdrew its personnel and fighters out of Luanda to its bases to the south. This opening of hostilities marks the beginning of the Angolan Civil War and a new phase of warfare for the people of Angola."
  Angola_Civil_War.1.d:0 "The uneasy truce between the three main Angolan parties, the FNLA, the MPLA, and UNITA ended in the capital. Soon after a new unity government was announced to transition the country to independence, fighting broke out between the MPLA and FNLA. The FNLA were accused of launching a coup and trying to assassinate the MPLA leader. After three months of fighting, the MPLA has finally driven the FNLA out of the capital. While the FNLA took many losses, UNITA fighters and supporters managed to withdraw in an orderly fashion. The MPLA said it acted to stop an FNLA coup backed by foreign powers. The FNLA claims it was all a conspiracy by the MPLA to seize power. Fighting among the three independence parties is expected to intensify as each has begun "
  Angola_Civil_War.2.d:0 "The Cuban government has long felt a revolutionary comradery with the MPLA in Angola. The MPLA in turn has repeatedly asked for help from Cuba and other revolutionary governments across the world. Over the previous weeks, the Cubans had responded to these requests by sending officers to assess MPLA needs. They have concluded the MPLA faces an existential threat from reactionary regimes and if they do not receive assistance soon, they may fall. With the final approval from the Cuban leadership, the Cuban military will begin deploying a large number of troops to Angola, via cargo ship and airplanes, in order to train, support, and bolster the MPLA against their enemies."
  Angola_Civil_War.3.d:0 "With the official deadline for Portugal granting Angola independence fast approaching, the FNLA launched an offensive to secure the capital Luanda. Doing so would give them legitimacy and take away one of the bastions of support for the MPLA. North of the city, the FNLA force decided to assault the strategic village of Quifangondo in order to have a base to secure the capital and control the water reservoir. Backed by South African and Zarian air and artillery support, the attack began early in the morning. However, a delay in the infantry assault saw the MPLA and their newly acquired Soviet rocket artillery operated by Cuban advisors devastate the attacking force. The FNLA lost almost all their vehicles and heavy equipment as they retreated. With victory assured the MPLA was poised to control Luanda when independence came."
  Angola_Civil_War.4.d:0 "With the official deadline for Portugal granting Angola independence fast approaching, the FNLA launched an offensive to secure the capital Luanda. Doing so would give them legitimacy and take away one of the bastions of support for the MPLA. North of the city, the FNLA force decided to capture the strategic village of Quifangondo in order to have a base to secure the capital and control the water reservoir. Backed by South African and Zarian air and artillery support, the attack began early in the morning. With MPLA forces dazed, the FNLA infantry immediately attacked, breaking through MPLA lines and forcing their enemy to retreat. The MPLA artillery could not be utilized in time as the FNLA poured through the lines immediately after their bombers and artillery finished softening the area. With the FNLA firmly secured, it appears they are poised to take Luanda before official independence is granted."
  Angola_Civil_War.5.d:0 "South Africa watched the rise of the communist MPLA very closely. They represented a threat to South Africa and were already organizing fighters to resist in Namibia. In order to prevent Namibian guerilla fighters a base of operations in Angola it was decided to support the FNLA and UNITA in their struggle against the MPLA. South Africa has initiated Operation Savannah to achieve this end. The operation began with South Africa launching a task force of conventionally trained FNLA fighters to attack the MPLA from the Namibian border. In the initial hours the task force has achieved great success and South African troops are preparing to move into Angola to support the mission. Ultimately Operation Savannah hopes to see the capture of Luanda and the end of the MPLA."
  Angola_Civil_War.6.d:0 "The FNLA task force of conventionally trained forces, working in conjunction with the South African military intervention force, have achieved lightening results. The MPLA have proven to be unable to resist the discipline and firepower of our forces. After a tough campaign and the arrival of foreign aid to the MPLA, the FNLA forces, backed by South Africa have completed the main objectives of Operation Savannah. With this success, it is hoped a moderate government will take over Angola and all support for Namibian guerilla fighters will be cut off, making them an easy target."
  Angola_Civil_War.7.d:0 "The FNLA task force of conventionally trained forces, working in conjunction with the South African military intervention force, had initially achieved lightening results. The initial MPLA resistance was quite meagre to the discipline and firepower of our forces. However, as Operation Savannah progressed, the enemy began receiving huge support in terms of equipment and foreign aid. Indeed, by the time the South African military realized it could not succeed it was apparent that South African forces were facing a better equipped enemy. Many South Africans blame the setback on a lack of international support to their efforts. Senior South African military officials also blame a failure of the government to secure international or media support for the operation."
  Angola_Civil_War.8.d:0 "The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) announced its independence from both Portugal and Angola. Cabinda was a Portuguese protectorate and until the twentieth century was a separate administration from Portuguese Angola. However, the Angolan government claims it is a part of Angola proper and have rejected the declaration of independence. FLEC actively participated in the war against Portuguese rule but claims it had been sidelined during the peace talks and want a recognized state. Despite the proclamation, it is expected that Angolan forces my soon move in to stop FLEC."
  Angola_Civil_War.9.d:0 "The government of Zaire has long engaged in the conflicts raging in Angola. Initially Zaire hoped to support an African nationalist overthrow of a colonial state but overtime its ambitions grew to trying to install a friendly government. After a series of military victories Zarian forces managed to break through enemy lines and seize control of the Angola capital of Luanda. With Zarian troops celebrating on the streets, the Zarian government released a statement saying it looked forward to having a productive relationship with the legitimate representatives of Angola. Many observers expect the Zarian government to install a friendly regime, however, it is unknown if they plan on annexing areas of the country."
  
  #Restoration of the Kongo
  Angola_Civil_War.10.d:0 "\nAfter a series of military successes, the FNLA has secured a military victory over the MPLA and UNITA. With this victory, the FNLA now controls the destiny of Angola. The FNLA announced its intention to reestablish the state of Kongo and give the Bakongo people the homeland Portugal stole from them in 1914 with the dissolution of the Kingdom of the Kongo. By breaking up Angola, the FNLA hopes to give all Angolans representation and prevent future unrest. The FNLA had long relied on support in northern Angola and from the Bakongo people in particular. How the rest of Angolans will react to the creation of successor states is unknown but the FNLA remains confidence its decision to split the country will lead to a wider peace."
  #Savimbi Victorious
  Angola_Civil_War.11.d:0 "UNITA emerged as a group offering to secure Angolan independence and the establishment of a state which secured citizens equality. Despite facing adversity in terms of being able to secure arms, equipment, and men, UNITA has finally been able to emerge victorious and occupies the capital Luanda. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has kept the movement going from the beginning and across Angola citizens have taken to the street chanting his name. Savimbi released a statement declaring Angola would embrace democracy and nonalignment to ensure no foreign ideology or state will pervert Angolan freedom. Many Angolans will anxiously wait to see if UNITA can deliver on its promises."
  #Retreat of the FNLA
  Angola_Civil_War.12.d:0 "The FNLA has militarily become so degraded that its forces are withdrawing into Zaire. The military route began earlier and as the FNLA defeats continued, its forces began withdrawing in increasing chaos, with bands of FNLA fighters rampaging through villages as they fled. Foreign aid to the group has largely ended and remaining foreign mercenaries fighting with the FNLA have also largely abandoned the fight. Although they expect to occupy bases and safe havens in Zaire, the new Angolan government has pledged it will deal with the remnants of the FNLA and push for Zaire to remove the group."
  #MPLA Victory
  Angola_Civil_War.13.d:0 "In a press release, the MPLA party announced it had finally achieved the wishes of the people and emerged victorious over their enemies. Despite facing threats from two powerful Angolan groups backed by foreign powers, the MPLA was able to defeat both groups after a series of victories. Now that peace is secure, the MPLA has announced it will bring true socialism to the people and establish regional party headquarters across the country. This will allow the party to uproot counterrevolutionary elements, crackdown on corruption and hoarding, and begin the process of distributing much needed goods to the people of Angola. In response to these statements by the MPLA, many in Angola cautiously welcome the end of civil war and hope MPLA rule will lead to stability and prosperity, not purges or repression."

 ANGOLA_IND.0.d:0 "Since the end of World War II, the rise of decolonization feelings led Portugal to pacify potential unrest in Angola.  However, restoring provincial rights and other reforms failed to prevent a few anti-colonial groups from organizing. Some advocate for local ethnic groups while others are driven by communist ideology. In recent months, the Portuguese government chose to use heavy military force to resolve a series of protests and unrest by peasants. This action pushed one of the anti-colonial groups, the Union of Peoples of Angola (UPA) to invade Angola from Congo-Leopoldville. Their seizure of Portuguese settler lands and farms instead of leading to a mass Portuguese flight instead saw the settlers stay in place and Portugal launch a counter-attack. The other emerging anti-colonial forces are expected to join the struggle against Portugal and each other. The Angolan War has launched and neither sides appears willing to throw in the towel."
 ANGOLA_IND.1.d:0 "Angolan workers at a cotton plantation run by the company Cotonang launched a massive protest. The goal was to push the company to improve working conditions. This led to violence against Portuguese employees at the plantation. News of the workers protest saw local villages join in, turning it into a revolt against the Portuguese colonial control of Angola. In response to these events, the colonial government deployed military forces and air power to suppress the uprising. The military action killed hundreds, with many villages reporting they were bombed indiscriminately by the Portuguese. The brutal suppression has greatly angered Angolan anti-colonial groups. The Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) spread rumors that civilian deaths were in the tens of thousands, further inflaming Angolan feeling."

 ANGOLA_SAF.1.d:0 "Our mobile task force crossed into MPLA territory. We had successfully identified a MPLA operational center which they had left lightly defended. The enemy did not expect our mobile forces to advance so rapidly and we easily broke through their lines. The assault made quick work of enemy resistance and the MPLA were defeated and forced to withdraw from the area. This success will make the MPLA think twice about trying to encroach on our interests."
 ANGOLA_SAF.2.d:0 "An overzealous officer made a major blunder yesterday. Perhaps over confident by the rapid mobile tactics being utilized, he sought to assault and destroy an MPLA camp in the area. However, the camp turned out to be fortified and prepared for an attack. Instead of falling apart under pressure, the enemy held their ground and inflicted casualties on our forces. We had to withdraw and the MPLA is already publicizing its victory over our forces in the area. The morale of our men has also been weakened by the engagement."
 ANGOLA_SAF.3.d:0 "Forces fighting in southern Angola against MPLA insurgents called for air support against a major attack. We dispatched several helicopters modified for close air support, these helicopters provided firepower, bombs, and missiles to drive off the enemy advance, with one bomb destroying an MPLA staff vehicle. The successful operation showcases the MPLA will have to face threats from the sky if they try to push towards our border."
 ANGOLA_SAF.4.d:0 "In southern Angola, we received requests for air support due to an MPLA attack. We dispatched several helicopters modified for close air support, however the helicopters were soon ambushed by MPLA forces waiting for them with light anti-aircraft weapons. Thankfully we did not lose any helicopters but the support mission to bomb the advancing MPLA forces had to be cancelled."

 ANGOLA_POR.11.d:0 "The FNLA has long engaged in a campaign of brutal violence against groups it considers loyal to our regime. In addition, Angolans of European heritage, even those of a European and African ancestry are also targets. This has allowed our intelligence officers to recruit men from villages victimized by the FNLA. In a recent operation we sent some of these men to join the FNLA and they in turn have fed us valuable intelligence linked to FNLA troop movements, morale, and tactical plans. This success will no doubt aid our efforts in not just containing the FNLA but finally eradicating the threat."
 ANGOLA_POR.12.d:0 "The FNLA has long engaged in a campaign of brutal violence against groups it considers loyal to our regime. In addition, Angolans of European heritage, even those of a European and African ancestry are also targets. We recently attempted to recruit a local leader whose villagers had faced FNLA attacks. We hoped he could reach out, become an FNLA supporter and then eventually feed us information regarding FNLA operations in his strategic area. However, once he joined the FNLA it became apparent he was a double agent. The information provided led to no successes and only stretched out our forces, resulting in the FNLA gaining territory form us. The operation to put a spy within the FNLA was ultimately a failure."
 ANGOLA_POR.15.d:0 "The FNLA claims it is a national movement for Angola. Occupying land and villages give them legitimacy. More importantly, villages become spaces they can setup facilities and administration structures, challenging the writ of Portugal. After gaining intelligence on the ground, a group of planes launched a daring bombing run targeting several villages under FNLA control. Intercepted radio transmissions confirm we destroyed command structures, administrative buildings, and supply stores. This will hinder the ability of the FNLA to supply and lead their men and has hurt their morale."
 ANGOLA_POR.16.d:0 "Acting on reports that the FNLA had breached into a village loyal to our administration, a few planes flew to offer close air support. They identified what they saw was a column of FNLA fighters and carried out a bombing. However, reports on the ground suggest the bombs may have missed their targets or even worse they had targeted a column of loyalists moving out of the village. Details are still unconfirmed, but the reports do say there is palpable panic and shock among the villagers and their loyalty to our cause appears to have been shaken."
 ANGOLA_POR.13.d:0 "The FNLA are very effective at attacking unarmed villagers, Portuguese settlers, or unarmed state officials. In a successful punitive operation, a lightly armed unit tracked a FNLA raiding party and once they had camped for the night, our men moved in. They quickly breached the defenses, surrounded the enemy and then launched their assault, destroying the FNLA force. More successful operations like these will continue to instill fear and show the FNLA cannot continue its campaign of terror."
 ANGOLA_POR.14.d:0 "A local police commander told the nearby military unit of an FNLA force massing to attack his village. The military unit mobilized to respond and drive off the FNLA but did not properly conduct reconnaissance or even a coherent strategy to clear the FNLA. Instead of catching the FNLA off-guard and surrounding them, the sweep launched by our troops saw the FNLA slip away. Indeed, several of our troops ended up going too far away from the main body during the confused operation and were cutdown by the FNLA as they withdrew with no losses. To add insult to injury, the village meant to be protected by our operation was attacked a week later."

 ANGOLA_POR.1.d:0 "The MPLA relies heavily on support from the urban elite in the capital. We have recently launched in operation in the capital where some loyal university educated Angolans of Portuguese ancestry were sent to join the MPLA. These operatives have risen quickly, aided by clandestine support and cash. They are now sending regular reports regarding MPLA efforts to spread its ideology to the countryside and undermine our authority. From this intelligence we have successfully rooted out in one area a parallel administration setup by the communist MPLA."
 ANGOLA_POR.2.d:0 "The MPLA relies heavily on support from the urban elite in the capital. We have recently launched in operation in the capital where some loyal university educated Angolans of Portuguese ancestry were sent to join the MPLA. Unfortunately, those agents ended up defecting and joining their cause. They revealed the process in which we place agents within their organization and as a result the MPLA launched a purge which rooted out a number of our agents within the organization, greatly hindering our ability to gain intelligence on the group."
 ANGOLA_POR.5.d:0 "One of our reconnaissance teams identified a small convoy, disguised as civilian vehicles moving men and equipment for the MPLA. We dispatched several aircraft who were able to bomb and destroy the convoy. When a unit reached the site, they discovered the MPLA had been transporting heavy mortars and heavy firearms along with the men in the convoy. The success will hinder their ability to target our outposts in the area and weaken their morale."
 ANGOLA_POR.6.d:0 "During a counter-insurgency sweep, one of our military commanders claimed to have engaged a major enemy force and called for an air support. We dispatched aircraft who hit the target extensively. However, upon inspection we discovered the coordinates were off and the commander had exaggerated the opposition he faced. The bombs hit nothing of value and unfortunately destroyed a farmhouse, no information on casualties yet. The attack has embarrassed us and is leading to protests from local villagers opposed to our use of excessive force."
 ANGOLA_POR.3.d:0 "A heavily armed task force was dispatched from one of our forward bases. This unit launched a quick cordon operation to encircle a nearby village suspected of housing MPLA forces. The unit engaged with enemy sentries outside the village before launching their full-on assault. Within a short frame of time the enemy forces were defeated with many casualties and prisoners. This rapid operation by a smaller, more mobile force showcases the effectiveness of more small-scale anti-insurgency tactics."
 ANGOLA_POR.4.d:0 "The general in charge of a strategic region mobilized his forces and conducted a massive sweep operation to root out the MPLA. Many towns and villages were searched along with the land. Despite a lot of press comments before the operation and boasts that the MPLA would be firmly dealt with, the operation yielded minimum results. It appears the MPLA got word of the operation due to the large-scale mobilizing and press conferences and had simply melted away. The appearance of MPLA fighters just a few days after the end of the operation only further emphasized its failure."

 ANGOLA_POR.21.d:0 "Although UNITA is very much opposed to our regime, its leadership consists of men who change their views on what the future of Angola must be. This has led to tensions within the group which our intelligence agents sought to exploit. In a recent operation, our agent posed as a supporter for one of the factions within UNITA and began funneling funds to senior UNITA leaders in that faction. In return these men were giving our agent valuable intelligence regarding their leadership structure, number of fighters, and logistical situation. The success of the operation will guarantee our forces will have an edge on the enemy and we can sow discontent within it as well."
 ANGOLA_POR.22.d:0 "Although UNITA is very much opposed to our regime, its leadership consists of men who change their views on what the future of Angola must be. This has led to tensions within the group which our intelligence agents sought to exploit. In a recent operation, our agent posed as a supporter for one of the factions within UNITA and funneled funds to senior UNITA leaders in the faction. However, it appears UNITA knew about this attempt and for a long time collected cash and at one point a major arms shipment by our agents desperate to get key information. In the end, no credible intelligence was gained and several of our assets within UNITA were purged as they figured out our methods. We will have to readjust to prevent future failures."
 ANGOLA_POR.25.d:0 "The UNITA fighters move in small bands and conduct frustrating hit and run operations against our forces as well as supporters. However, we recently uncovered that a senior UNITA commander had turned a house in a village deep within their zone of operation as a command post. Apparently, this commander was overly confident we could not reach him or that we would not discover his movement. This proved to be a costly mistake as several of our aircraft bombed the command post, destroying the UNITA forces command in that area. The successful operation will only bolster our morale and hurt theirs."
 ANGOLA_POR.26.d:0 "The UNITA fighters move in small bands and conduct frustrating hit and run operations against our forces as well as supporters. In an embarrassing incident, we received coordinates from what was called an intelligence asset on a UNITA band operating in an area. However, after our aircraft bombed the target it was clear we had not hit anything and that UNITA planted the intelligence. The strikes were done in an area clearly visible to many villagers and UNITA had promised they would scare us so much they would easily convince us to bomb that specific location. This has ultimately boosted their standing in the area and lowered the support of villagers towards our cause."
 ANGOLA_POR.23.d:0 "A daring junior officer successfully identified the pattern of movement of a UNITA band which had launched several brutal hit and run attacks targeting government forces and supporters. He understood UNITA fighters avoided direct combat with superior opponents and often setup ambush points when preparing for an attack to avoid being surprised by an enemy force. However, our officer figured out their pattern and positioned his troops were he thought the UNITA commander would place his men in preparation for an attack on a nearby village. When the UNITA fighters arrived, they faced an ambush and our forces emerged victorious. We inflicted casualties and many enemy fighters abandoned their weapons in the retreat."
 ANGOLA_POR.24.d:0 "One of our commanders decided on launching a sizable cordon operation to root out UNITA fighters from his area. His men were under constant guerrilla attacks by the enemy and he wanted to take the fight to UNITA. However, the operation proved a massive failure, UNITA largely withdrew from the area being searched and whenever our units strayed away from the main body, they faced quick strikes by UNITA fighters. Ultimately the operation yielded virtually no UNITA fighters or stores of enemy supplies and we took several casualties. The morale of our men has been depleted in the area following this failed attempt."

 ANGOLA_ANG.15.d:0 "The FNLA seized a strategically valuable village, driving out its residents and establishing a strong position from which to coordinate its efforts to pushing us down south. However, several squadrons coordinated their mortar units and in a predawn attack dropped so many bombs that many of the FNLA fighters, including several of their leaders, fled, the position was easily retaken later in the day."
 ANGOLA_ANG.16.d:0 "The FNLA pulled a surprise on an attempted mortar bombardment by our forces. The regional commander thought his forces could position themselves and hit a number of strongpoints held by FNLA fighters. However, as the mortar team setup, the FNLA launched their own mortars along with an infantry attack. This assault forced our men to flee and they left behind the mortars and other valuable equipment. This was a big success for the FNLA in the area and local villagers appear to be siding with them now. We suspect these tactical maneuvering is probably the result of foreign advisors bent on putting out the flame of our revolution."
 ANGOLA_ANG.13.d:0 "A recent FNLA offensive drove out our forces from several villages. The FNLA appeared to have withdrawn but an experienced commander discovered they were operating from a sympathetic village located near the sites of their attacks. Overnight our men surrounded the village and the next day several routine FNLA patrols which left the village were ambushed. When the enemy realized they were surrounded, many surrendered or went into a panic, our forces managed to complete the assault and captured weapons and documents from the enemy. News of our successful assault has galvanized the villages in the area to support us and weakened the influence of their chieftains."
 ANGOLA_ANG.14.d:0 "An overzealous force of ours sought to drive off an FNLA incursion into our territory. The commander thought a quick assault on their main camp would force the FNLA to withdraw. However, a failure to properly prepare the assault saw our men walk into an ambush outside their camp. The shock of the enemy attack caused a panic as our forces withdrew. In addition to the casualties, we lost equipment and some of our men were taken as prisoners. The FNLA is treating the victory as confirmation to their cause and support for the revolution has been depleted in the region."
 ANGOLA_ANG.11.d:0 "We have acquired evidence against the son of a prominent chieftain supporter of the FNLA who is studying at a prominent university abroad. Using this blackmail, we have convinced him to begin providing us detailed information regarding the FNLA plans and tactics. Thanks to the information so far, we were able to thwart an effort to assault a village of our supporters. We expect the information he provides will prove vital in our efforts to defeat this reactionary threat to our revolution."
 ANGOLA_ANG.12.d:0 "It is common practice for some of our armed cadre to be sent to join a rival group in order to gather information and sow discontent. However, one of our agents within the FNLA apparently has been bribed to defect and turn on the people and our party. The traitor managed to convince his handler to bring in several other agents in order to coordinate an operation which would have seen the FNLA lose several prominent leaders, however, this was all a ruse and the FNLA managed to capture the handlers and those agents."

 ANGOLA_ANG.21.d:0 "There are many within the UNITA space who see the ideology of the party as veering away from its origins. Some of these dissenters believe in a revolutionary government like we do, and our agents have successfully turned a political leader of UNITA to act as an agent for us. His position allows him close communication with senior UNITA military commanders and the information he has already provided gives us a strong picture of their tactics, morale, and planned operations. This boon in intelligence will allow us to target UNITA far more effectively."
 ANGOLA_ANG.22.d:0 "A team of intelligence agents argued the humble origins of UNITA, and its leadership would make it particularly vulnerable to intellectual leaders who could rapidly rise through the ranks and breakup the group internally for us. This plan failed as the men recruited to infiltrate the ranks of UNITA proved not well-prepared for the assignment and were rooted out fairly quickly. However, the agents who had setup the operation themselves were nearly all captured as UNITA proved it could spring its own trap on our agents. Fortunately, most of our agents escaped but the infiltration operation was a failure."
 ANGOLA_ANG.25.d:0 "One of our most seasoned squadron leaders executed a brilliant operation against a UNITA basecamp near our territory. He directed a small force to recon a strategic area from which UNITA fighters had been hitting our supply lines. The force found a rebel camp and during the night a mortar team moved into position. They then zeroed in and bombed the camp. After the bombing ended, the rest of the squadron assaulted the position, finding it abandoned by UNITA fighters terrified by our show of force. Enemy documents, casualties, and equipment were seized from the camp."
 ANGOLA_ANG.26.d:0 "A squadron commander had been making a series of mortar strikes on UNITA forward positions, however, he apparently grew complacent as his latest attempt resulted in a major setback. UNITA had leaked over the radio, perhaps intentionally, that it was stockpiling men and weapons at a post familiar to our commander. Perhaps he sensed the chance to inflict mass damage through a mortar strike on the location, however, as soon as his squadron began moving into position, a UNITA force ambushed them, inflicting casualties, taking prisoners and capturing a number of mortars. Now our outposts are being bombarded by our own mortars, hurting the morale of our forces."
 ANGOLA_ANG.23.d:0 "A small band of UNITA fighters have been raiding villages under our protection and launching hit and run attacks on our outposts over the previous few weeks. The commander in the area was able to discover the general location of the enemy basecamp. Utilizing superior numbers, he encircled the area and then conducted a sweep, discovering the enemy camp. Our forces then conducted an assault, destroying the UNITA base and taking a number of prisoners."
 ANGOLA_ANG.24.d:0 "An attempt to flush out a UNITA controlled area of its fighters and assert our control ended in failure. Our forces, consisting of several squadrons sought to secure a number of villages and lure the enemy into a fight or catch them off-guard. However, the villages lacked supply or ammunition dumps and efforts to locate fighters only enraged villagers who felt their liberties were being violated. As the troops moved on, they did meet UNITA fighters but they were dug in and well-prepared. We took heavy casualties and UNITA fighters continued to harass our forces until we withdrew."

 ANGOLA_ANG.1.d:0 "A young, Angolan colonial bureaucrat has been secretly approached by several of our operatives. He expressed his disillusionment with the colonial regime and promised to report on information related to the distribution of supplies, cash, and weapons across his region. This valuable intelligence will tell us which locals are siding with the colonizers and where enemy troops are being concentrated for future operations."
 ANGOLA_ANG.2.d:0 "At the university in Luanda, an operation to get few upcoming graduates sympathetic to our cause to join the colonial government and military in order to gather intelligence was broken up. Not only were the students arrested but so were their handlers and some of our top recruiters on campus. The plan appeared doomed from the start as our handlers bundled the operation by recruiting students who were known supporters of ours. The Portuguese officials easily figured out the plan and rolled up the operation."
 ANGOLA_ANG.5.d:0 "A police barrack outside Luanda was heavily bombed by a mortar team of our fighters. The shells caused extensive damage and led to a huge explosion when the armory was hit. The colonial police forces took casualties but more importantly, the ability of our fighters to conduct such an operation and then quickly slip away without being caught has raised our credibility among the people."
 ANGOLA_ANG.6.d:0 "A local commander thought he could bomb a colonial military camp with a mortar team, however when his fighters tried to move into position, a patrol of enemy troops spotted them. The ensuing fight saw our forces take several casualties and the capture of valuable mortars. The Portuguese commander took the captured weapons and bombs to the local village and stated we intended to shell the villagers indiscriminately to spread fear. Our prestige and support in the area has been depleted."
 ANGOLA_ANG.3.d:0 "In a classic guerilla warfare maneuver, a small convoy of Portuguese military supply trucks was hit by a squadron of our fighters. The enemy was completely unprepared for the heavy firepower and rapid withdrawal of our forces after extensive damage was inflicted. The commander reported almost all the trucks had been disabled or destroyed with heavy enemy casualties. Many locals are now spreading word of our triumph and rumors abound that the Portuguese may soon abandon their posts in the area if supply trucks cannot move freely."
 ANGOLA_ANG.4.d:0 "One of our squadron commanders led his force to what was believed to be an isolated Portuguese military force consisting of mostly African soldiers. The commander assumed a heavy assault would see most of the troops either surrender or defect, giving us a major victory and a cache of arms. However, when the fighting opened the resistance from the base was stiff and enemy troop numbers were much higher than anticipated. Our fighters quickly withdrew but it was disorderly, and an enemy force sent to pursue ended up inflicting heavy casualties and taking prisoners. The squadron commander has been removed from his position for failing to properly anticipate or recon the colonial forces."

 ANGOLA_FNL.1.d:0 "We represent the will of the nation and will unite the country under an Angolan government not controlled by foreign states or foreign ideologies. This appeal resonates strongly with Angolans still connected to the colonial regime who know they will never achieve high rank or status as long as Portuguese rule continues. In a recent operation, our operatives were able to convince a midlevel colonial Angolan official to feed us valuable intelligence regarding Portuguese intentions and movements. He will also connect us to others sympathetic to our mission."
 ANGOLA_FNL.2.d:0 "We represent the will of the nation and will unite the country under an Angolan government not controlled by foreign states or foreign ideologies. This appeal resonates strongly with Angolans still connected to the colonial regime who know they will never achieve high rank or status as long as Portuguese rule continues. A recent attempt to convince a midlevel Angolan official to feed us intelligence proved disastrous. The official immediately reported the operatives to his superiors who captured the men. Following their arrest, a number of sympathetic officials were removed by the colonial state and our efforts at gathering intelligence has resulted in failure."
 ANGOLA_FNL.5.d:0 "A Portuguese social club located in a major settlement has been under surveillance by our supporters for a while. It was decided that the security at the location was weak and we could plant explosives. The mission to plant the bombs was a success and the social club was destroyed. This has shaken Portuguese officials and settlers and we hope this will cause many in the area to leave Angola and raise our own standing among the people."
 ANGOLA_FNL.6.d:0 "A team moving explosives to conduct a bombing operation against a Portuguese facility was intercepted at a police roadblock. The men apparently drew suspicion and were quickly arrested by the Portuguese. The explosives were shown to the locals and Portuguese settlers and the colonial authorities claim we were about to conduct a terroristic campaign against civilians, seeking to discredit us and showcase to the settlers that their safety was secured."
 ANGOLA_FNL.3.d:0 "A plantation run by a Portuguese settler family was quickly overrun by our forces. This provoked the local authorities to dispatch forces to repel our attack and they in turn fell into a ambush. The raid and ambush netted us cash, weapons, supplies, and goods we can sell for the cause. Psychologically, our success against the settlers will hopefully serve as an example and push them to leave Angola to our people."
 ANGOLA_FNL.4.d:0 "Our commander identified a village sympathetic to the Portuguese colonial government, offering them supplies and men. The commander thought the village was poorly defended and planned on launching an assault to destroy Portuguese facilities and security force presence to show the village it must change its ways. However, when our fighters moved to launch its rapid assault, a Portuguese patrol in the area spotted them and attacked the rear of our forces. They inflicted heavy casualties and forced our men to fall back, the attempted raid was a failure."
	
 ANGOLA_FNL.11.d:0 "The FNLA represents an Angola free of foreign imperialists and foreign ideologies. The MPLA is a clear slave to a foreign ideology and must be stopped. Among their ranks there are those who fear their leaders are moving them to places outside Angolan cultural or social norms. These are also men who are not rewarded for their talents and our operatives have recently convinced an uncertain senior MPLA commander to begin feeding us information in exchange for monetary assistance. The information we have already gleaned has told us much of their organization, tactics, and morale. We hope to utilize this information to better target their forces in the field."
 ANGOLA_FNL.12.d:0 "Today we suffered a major embarrassment. We had sent a senior operative to recruit an MPLA official to provide us with information. We had hoped the offer of joining us in the national cause and cash would convince the official. Initially we were informed the operation had been a success, but we soon realized the information we received led our forces to several ambushes or into areas without any MPLA presence, stretching out our forces. Before we could put it together that we were being played, the MPLA official arranged a meeting with two of our operatives and the MPLA captured them. The operation to acquire sources within the MPLA has ended in failure."
 ANGOLA_FNL.15.d:0 "The MPLA has a vast party apparatus that seeks to exploit and use propaganda to brainwash supporters among the Angolan people. Another method of control they use is to distribute resources to villages by quota in certain areas. To take advantage and hurt the support locals give the MPLA, a team of ours recently blew up several store houses in MPLA territory. The destruction of these resources has led to a shortage of essential goods for local villagers and this is raising anti-MPLA feeling and boosting the morale of our own party in the area."
 ANGOLA_FNL.16.d:0 "The MPLA recently discovered a group of our fighters moving behind their lines in order to plant explosives targeting their leadership and facilities. Details of how the men were caught remains unknown, however the MPLA have wasted no time in parading the explosives to local people. They have started a vicious series of lies claiming the bombs were meant to target markets and schools in an effort to use fear as a means to get villagers to support our just cause."
 ANGOLA_FNL.13.d:0 "The MPLA force generally lacks professional officers or discipline. We fortunately can rely on outside volunteers who have extensive knowledge on military discipline and tactics. One of those volunteers recently led a force of our men he trained to an MPLA basecamp. Utilizing reconnaissance and infiltration tactics, our men managed to breach the enemy camp without detection leading to an assault. We overran the camp, inflicting casualties, taking prisoners, and capturing important documents from the enemy."
 ANGOLA_FNL.14.d:0 "A FNLA chieftain recently chastised the FNLA commander in his area for not reacting or preventing attacks by the MPLA. The chieftain was also telling locals he feared villages would soon fall to the MPLA leading to population unrest. The commander decided he would end these criticisms and moved against the MPLA base operating in the area. However, the MPLA apparently were prepared and turned the assault by our fighters into a trap and routed our men. We took heavy casualties and now morale among the villagers is said to have nearly collapsed."
	
 ANGOLA_FNL.21.d:0 "UNITA has long operated without an extensive financial or ideological base in terms of what it desires. This has worked into our advantage as we recently sent a fighter to join their forces and rise to the ranks as our agent. His efforts have borne fruit as he has been able to rise up, often by using money we provide to bribe his way to the top, and he has found several UNITA officers and officials willing to aid us for cash or aid in helping them rise to higher positions within UNITA. This network has already offered valuable intelligence on UNITA and has helped us protect key assets from enemy sabotage."
 ANGOLA_FNL.22.d:0 "UNITA has long operated without an extensive financial or ideological base in terms of what it desires. We thought we could use that to our advantage by recruiting a UNITA commander with cash to provide us with intelligence. However, the UNITA commander proved to be a double agent and he collected a lot of cash and supplies from us in exchange for intelligence which ultimately led to no major successes. He was finally found out when our operative accidently gave him some minor intelligence which UNITA used to ambush our forces. Once this was realized, we cut off ties with him but the operation to acquire an agent within UNITA proved a failure."
 ANGOLA_FNL.25.d:0 "A UNITA commander living comfortably across the border in a camp became the target of a team of our fighters. The fighters smuggled across the border with explosives and destroyed the home of the commander. It is unknown at the moment how many casualties were taken but the attack has demonstrated to UNITA that they cannot escape our wrath. The morale of our forces was raised when news came that a brutal enemy commander had been so effectively targeted by our forces."
 ANGOLA_FNL.26.d:0 "Due to the justness of our cause, we have been fortunate to have many volunteers come from abroad to aid in the struggle to create an Angola free of foreign governments and ideologies. To showcase our strength, we had planned on demolishing the major buildings of an abandoned village which fled up the arrival of our forces. We wanted to deny the UNITA sympathizers a functional village to return to, however, when the buildings were destroyed, we discovered the villagers had been held by UNITA fighters out of fear that they would support our advancing forces. By destroying the buildings, we ensured they were now going to be UNITA supporters making the bombing a failure."
 ANGOLA_FNL.23.d:0 "The UNITA fighters follow a set of rules and tactics to minimize losses and inflict casualties. One of our commanders realized the UNITA band of fighters he faced appeared to cut corners in terms of setting up ambushes and ensuring routes of retreat. After careful planning he advanced into their zone of operation, provoking an ambush he knew would happen, but he had a smaller force already positioned behind the enemy and was able to pin down and defeat the UNITA force. He inflicted losses, took prisoners, and captured enemy weapons, no doubt hindering their ability to operate effectively in the area."
 ANGOLA_FNL.24.d:0 "The UNITA tend to disappear in the face of superior forces and in a recent engagement our commander suffered dearly for assuming that would happen. The commander had a larger than usual force and recent UNITA actions in the area indicated they had a much smaller force. The commander tracked the UNITA fighters into a specific location. He decided to launch an assault, push them out and then pursue the enemy. However, his assumption of having superior numbers and a UNITA withdrawal were misplaced as the UNITA had amassed a much larger force their and they did not withdraw during the attack. Our forces were forced to fall back after taking heavy casualties and are currently on the defensive."

 ANGOLA_UNT.1.d:0 "The Portuguese have long been overstretched and have made it a point to recruit from Angolans to fill their ranks. We have taken advantage of this and have sent some of our cadres to join these militias. The recent effort has bore fruit as these infiltrators have smuggled valuable arms and supplies for our fighters. More significantly these men spread the message of UNITA within the ranks and provide us key intelligence which we are using to move men into position to strike effectively."
 ANGOLA_UNT.2.d:0 "The Portuguese have long been overstretched and have made it a point to recruit from Angolans to fill their ranks. We have taken advantage of this and have sent some of our cadres to join these militias. The recent effort has proven disastrous however. It appears the allure of cash has caused a number of our infiltrators to defect. They reported our infiltration efforts and have uprooted a lot of our sympathizers within the colonial militias. A few bands of fighters were also ambushed due to this betrayal."
 ANGOLA_UNT.5.d:0 "A band of our fighters identified a vulnerable government building in a contested village. Overnight the men placed explosives and in the morning,  we destroyed this symbol of the Portuguese imperialist regime. The villagers were said to be awed by our success and a number have come to join our fighters or offer food to the men operating in the area. This success will raise morale."
 ANGOLA_UNT.6.d:0 "An attempt to blow up an enemy police checkpoint ended in disaster overnight. Our band of fighters thought they had identified a weak point from which to enter and place explosives, but they were intercepted and captured by colonial police. The men are expected to be publicly executed and the Portuguese have publicized the explosives as evidence of a terrorist plot targeting civilians. The morale of our fighters has been hit and villagers are now more in fear to support our cause."
 ANGOLA_UNT.3.d:0 "During a recent sweep by Portuguese forces, one of our bands tracked a unit which went beyond the main force. The fighters were able to ambush the unit, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing arms and ammunition which is always needed for our fighters. Mao himself would be proud of how the men performed. The Portuguese forces quickly withdrew, and the morale of our men was greatly raised following the success."
 ANGOLA_UNT.4.d:0 "A troubling report reached the leadership today. A band of our fighters suffered heavily losses to colonial troops during a failed attack at an enemy outpost. The commander apparently failed to follow our tactical procedures and instead of attacking when the enemy is at its weakest, he hit them when they were strong and dug in. A directive will be issued to all commanders reminding them that we must not throw away our forces in feeble efforts."

 ANGOLA_UNT.11.d:0 "The MPLA has long claimed to be the revolutionary party of Angola, however, their decadence and brutality has disillusioned many in their ranks. An important regional commander expressed sympathies to the UNITA cause and our operatives were able to make contact. From him we are gaining valuable intelligence about MPLA movements and tactics. We are expecting our influence to grow as a result of this infiltration within the MPLA ranks."
 ANGOLA_UNT.12.d:0 "The MPLA has long claimed to be the revolutionary party of Angola, however, their decadence and brutality has disillusioned many in their ranks. Several of our operatives thought they could convince a MPLA member to act as a mole within their ranks. He would have spread our views and provided key intelligence, however, this turned out to be a trap. The operatives were captured and following a brutal interrogation, the MPLA purged some of our sympathizers within their ranks."
 ANGOLA_UNT.15.d:0 "The MPLA have established party stations in villages and towns across their area of control. To show the people we are the true representatives of Angola, a team of our fighters were able to plant explosives and blow up a MPLA party facility in a strategic village. By destroying this propaganda facility, we have shown the MPLA lacks the ability to protect itself. If they cannot do that than how can they protect or represent the people? Our success will raise UNITA in the minds of the people and instill fear among the MPLA."
 ANGOLA_UNT.16.d:0 "An ambitious band of our fighters sought to plant explosives and destroy an MPLA storehouse. However, they did not scout the location as well as they should have, and they were killed during the process of planting the explosives. The MPLA in the area have received a major boost in morale. Our own fighters are said to be feeling depleted by this failed effort. The MPLA has spread rumors that our men were planning on committing indiscriminate violence against the population to hurt our standing."
 ANGOLA_UNT.13.d:0 "Mao would have been proud of our forces today. At an MPLA occupied village, a small band of fighters ambushed several sentries who had strayed out of the village. The rest of the force at the village returned fire but a larger band of our men opened up on the other side. The MPLA split their forces and moved to face this new threat but they walked into a trap as another hidden group then opened up on the exposed MPLA force, hitting them from different sides. After inflicting heavy casualties, the fighters withdrew in victory."
 ANGOLA_UNT.14.d:0 "An MPLA commander, no doubt familiar with our tactics turned an attack by our fighters into a route. The MPLA showed extraordinary discipline to not walk into a trap by not marching to face where the diversionary force was firing from. Instead, a smaller force of MPLA fighters snuck at the flank and wreaked havoc. They drove our forces away, inflicting casualties and capturing abandoned weapons which they paraded as trophies to the villagers. Local morale has taken a major hit."

 ANGOLA_UNT.21.d:0 "The FNLA operates as a reactionary force bent on creating a new oppression for the people of Angola. They rely on outside money and support to keep people loyal to them. In order to gain intelligence and access to vital supplies and weapons, we have launched in operation to send some cadres to join them as fighters. The operation was a success and the men are providing us essential information and where we can take their supplies. More significantly, we are also able to spread our mission to the ranks and sow discontent."
 ANGOLA_UNT.22.d:0 "An attempt by our operatives to turn some FNLA fighters to become informants to the cause ended in disaster. Initially, we were able to acquire information from these sources to capture supplies and weapons, however, this was simply a trap. These betrayers led some of our key operatives into a trap and after they were captured, some of our supporters within the FNLA ranks were discovered and dealt wit by the brutal FNLA leadership."
 ANGOLA_UNT.25.d:0 "The FNLA have conducted brutal operations to cower villages and towns into accepting their authority. In one of these towns we discovered the home of a major FNLA supporter. Our fighters were able to setup bombs and destroyed the house. This stunning bombing of a major FNLA supporter brought fear to the FNLA and brought us support from many of the locals who despised the man."
 ANGOLA_UNT.26.d:0 "A bomb planting unit was captured trying to sneak inside an FNLA controlled village. The men had explosives and other equipment for their mission and are expected to be brutally dealt with by the local FNLA commander. This success has raised the morale of our enemy and made our own fighters unsure about the orders given by their superiors."
 ANGOLA_UNT.23.d:0 "The cowardly FNLA assaulted a defenseless village that supported our cause. In retaliation, several leading commanders in the area met to plan our retaliation. Utilizing our traditional tactics, the FNLA forces were lured outside the village where we attacked on multiple sides, the cowardly FNLA quickly fled, taking heavy casualties and abandoning weapons. From the few prisoners captured, we realized one of them was from a foreign state and are currently interrogating to find out from where he came from."
 ANGOLA_UNT.24.d:0 "An attempt by one of our bands to assault what appeared to be a straggling unit of FNLA fighters turned into a disastrous defeat. The enemy held their ground and ended up pinning a number of our fighters. This allowed FNLA reinforcements to come in and inflict a high number of casualties among our men. We suspect the FNLA stragglers may have actually been a unit of trained soldiers from a neighboring state brought in to bolster the FLNA cause."

 angola_war.1.d:0 "The postwar wave of decolonization and African nationalism has swept across the Portuguese colony of Angola. A protest against working conditions saw Portugal use excessive force to assert their rule. However, this only provoked three major anti-colonial movements to come out and fight the Portuguese by targeting European settlers.

 Angola_Expulsion.1.d:0 "Zambia had long opened its borders to the groups opposing the Portuguese colonial regime in Angola. In addition, it facilitated the movement of arms, supplies, and trainers to anti-colonial groups in the region as this fit with the Zambian belief in anti-colonial resistance and African nationalism. However, Zambia recently announced it would be expelling the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) from its lands. The Zambian government said the group was taking advantage of Zambian facilities, harassing Zambian citizens, and plotting against the government. Privately, many note the Zambian government also feared Portuguese cross border operations which could destabilize the government. In addition, UNITA had been targeting Portuguese infrastructure in Angola, including rail links that connected Zambian goods to the coast and the refusal of UNITA to not target such routes also infuriated the government."

However, the Zambian government announced it would be expelling the Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) from its lands. They cited that the MPLA were plotting against the government, harassing Zambians, and not concentrating on its mission to free Angola. Privately, there are rumors the government also feared provoking Portugal into launching more direct cross border operations which could destabilize the country."
 Angola_Expulsion.2.d:0 "The FNLA long found support from Zaire in terms of military advisors, arms, and bases from which to fight the Portuguese colonial regime. However, this changed with the recent announcement by the government of Zaire that the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) would be expelled from the country. Zaire stated the FNLA were abusing the generosity of Zaire and had simply become a group accumulating wealth not fighting for freedom. Privately, many suggest Zaire feared Portugal may conduct operations across the border and destabilize the government. In addition, Zaire had hopped FNLA successes in northern Angola would have opened mineral resources for them, but this has not happened leading to the increasing frustration."
 Carnation_Revolution.0.d:0 "The Portuguese government and military have begun their official withdrawal from Angola. Reports in Luanda describe naval ships and passenger jets being loaded with Portuguese officials and soldiers. This marks the end of Portuguese colonial rule in the country and an end to its military conflict with Angolan independence fighters. The Portuguese action came after it secured an agreement with the various independence groups who agreed to the withdrawal in exchange for the establishment of a transitional government. After more than four centuries of engagement with the region, Portugal is finally out of its most valuable colony in Africa. Many Angolans are said to be overjoyed at the prospect of their country finally achieving independence, though uncertainty remains over whether the transitional government can keep the various political groups together."
 Carnation_Revolution.1.d:0 "The people of Portugal have endured autocratic rule for nearly half a century. The government emphasis on corporatism alienates working class Portuguese while the unpopular colonial wars drain wealth and cost lives. The recent book by General Antonio Spinola, who commanded forces in one of the colonial wars, points out the corruption and leadership mistakes costing the country and calls for reforms. Inspired by his message, a disenchanted cabal of young officers, called the Armed Forces Movement planned a coup. Using pre-arranged music broadcasts as signals, the rebel officers and soldiers seized strategic points and buildings across the country. Incredibly, this military coup turned into a popular revolution as tens of thousands took to the streets in support of the rebels and hand them carnations. This public support helped convince the government to resign and hand power to a junta led by Spinola which has promised a swift transition to democracy for Portugal."
 Carnation_Revolution.2.d:0 "The recent book by General Antonio Spinola, who commanded forces in one of the colonial wars, points out the corruption and folly of the government. He calls for reforms and inspired a cabal within the military called the Armed Forces Movement. This group planned a coup that would commence following pre-arranged music broadcasts. However, the second signal was never broadcast. This led to a situation where the rebel units, reacting to the first signal moved into position but did not act. This allowed loyalist forces to realize the situation and respond. Within hours most of the rebel units were disarmed. Some units did attempt to carry out their objectives, but these sporadic actions were easily handled by regime forces. The coup attempt was an immense failure and will likely lead to a purge of radical officers in the military. Although the government claimed to have crushed a Marxist plot, many civilians are unconvinced and are said to be despondent over the news."

 Portugal_Victory_Angola.1.d:0 "The recent military successes against the communist MPLA has seen their apparatus and insurgent networks virtually completely uprooted within Angola. Our forces patrol unhindered and our intelligence agencies keep an effective eye across MPLA centers of influence, especially on school campuses. The MPLA has effectively been expelled from Angola, its remaining fighters operate out of neighboring states and any incursions they make usually result in their withdrawal. With the MPLA effectively outside Angola, Portugal hopes to consolidate and restore its authority across the entire colony."
 Portugal_Victory_Angola.3.d:0 "UNITA emerged as a Maoist style guerrilla force operating in southeast Angola. Their frustrating tactics had caused many problems for Portuguese forces. However, following a series of military setbacks and intelligence failures, the Portuguese state has effectively forced UNITA out of Angola. Without a base in Angola, the remaining fighters are said to be based across the border of neighboring states but do not have the ability to hold Angolan territory. With UNITA effectively removed from Angola, Portugal hopes to consolidate and restore its authority across the entire colony."
 Portugal_Victory_Angola.2.d:0 "The FNLA came to the scene attempting to drive Portuguese settlers out of Angola through a campaign of escalating violence. However, the recent Portuguese military and intelligence successes has seen the group virtually uprooted from across Angola, especially in its base of support in northern Angola. The remaining FNLA fighters are said to be based in neighboring states but have not shown a capacity to hold Angolan territory. With the FNLA effectively removed from Angola, Portugal hopes to consolidate and restore its authority across the entire colony."

 Angola_Prelude.1.d:0 "In an effort to better coordinate its efforts to liberate Angola from Portugal, the Union of Peoples of Angola (UPA) agreed to unify with the Partido Democratico de Angola (PDA) to form the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA). This will also allow the UPA, which initially was a Bakongo separatist organization, to become a national organization for the liberation of all Angola. It has expanded its scope as an ethnic and political movement. The anti-colonial, anti-settler, and ethnic based ideology of the group makes it very popular, especially to neighboring states seeking to support anti-colonial efforts as they fear a more communist oriented group may harbor broader regional ambitions."
 Angola_Prelude.2.d:0 "The Angolan Communist Party under Viriato da Cruz has merged with the Party for the United Struggle for Africans in Angola (PLUA) to form the Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). This merging will combine the intelligentsia and urban activists of the colonial capital Luanda with the Ambundu ethnic group. This base will ideally allow the organization to effectively organize, withstand outside pressure, and establish itself as the premier movement for the liberation of Angola."

 UNITA.1.d:0 "Jonas Savimbi and Antonio de Costa Fernandes have formed the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA). Savimbi originally was with the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) but felt it lacked enough of a grassroots approach, especially in terms of peasant reform. The founding of UNITA saw hundreds of delegates meet in southeastern Portuguese Angola. The group seeks to draw support from the Ovimbundu ethnic group. UNITA espouses a more Maoist line and expects to cooperate its campaign against Portugal with the Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). UNITA will fight not just Portugal but also other groups "ideologically opposed to it. Whether it can maintain cooperation with the MPLA will have to be seen."
