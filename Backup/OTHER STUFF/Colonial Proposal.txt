Got an ingenious idea
while eating at waffle house
-decolonization targetted modifier
representing the native bureacracy and competencies
upon independence the malus hits them and it changes with the variable
more so
if its below x
the historical strategy plans
to the alt one
ie
for the congo if it has x lumumba stays in power and the crisis is converted
if its lower but higher then otl
the crisis still fires
but instead of mobutu seizing power, tshombe takes over
for the colonial gui
3-4 variables per colony (some will have a 4th most will not)
1.) Colonial Militancy
2.) Domestic Support
3.) Domestic Bureaucratic Capability (Name WIP; represents the level of native educated intelligentsia, officers and professionals there are in relative to the colonial pop)

Optional (Depending on Colony)
4.) Settler Population
5.) Settler Militancy
